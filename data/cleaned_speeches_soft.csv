01.01.1994,Kim Jong Il,"As we see 1993 out and the new year 1994 in, I would like to dwell on some problems that the Party needs to tackle in its work. Last year was the grimmest year in the history of our Party. In an attempt to isolate and suffocate our country, the bastion of socialism, the US imperialists last year resorted to unprecedented machinations against socialism and our Republic, and staged the Team Spirit joint military exercise, citing as an excuse the nuclear inspection issue. This created a touch-and-go situation in our country, and our Party and people were faced with the choice of whether to defend socialism or not. Determined to answer the enemy’s counterrevolutionary offensive with a revolutionary offensive, our Party ensured that the Supreme Commander of the Korean People’s Army issued an order to the effect that the whole country, all the people and the entire army should go over to a semi-war state, and after that took the resolute step of withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, thus rousing all its members, and all the other people and soldiers to the struggle to shatter the aggressive moves of the enemy. The political and military confrontation with the US imperialists last year was a showdown without gunshot and an all-people life-or-death battle to 356 defend our Party and our socialist motherland. In this fierce confrontation we achieved a great victory in political, ideological, moral, strategic and tactical terms. This is the greatest success we gained last year. In last year’s showdown we once again humbled the US imperialists and demonstrated to the world that socialist Korea under the leadership of the great leader and the great Party is a fiercely independent country that will brook no provocation. When, to cope with the enemy’s manoeuvres to start a nuclear war, we took the resolute steps of proclaiming a semi-war state and withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the leaders and broad sections of the public of many countries expressed admiration for our Party, saying that Korea was handling the situation well, and progressive parties, organizations and people across the world expressed active support for our self-defence measures. Through last year’s showdown with the enemy, our Party was further tempered and the singlehearted unity of the Party and the people and the capabilities of the People’s Army were strengthened incomparably. Our great victory can be attributed to the wise leadership of the Party and the leader and to the reliable foundations laid by the leader. We could stand up to the enemy because the leader had, at the cost of a great deal of effort, set up an independent defence industry in the past. The victory was also secured by the brave struggle of the people and the People’s Army soldiers, who are united firmly around the Party and the leader. When the semi-war state was proclaimed our people, in support of the Supreme Commander’s order, gave moral and material assistance to the People’s Army, while achieving feats of labour at their workplaces, and the servicemen of the People’s Army defended their posts with a grim determination, once the order for battle was given, to fight to the death for the Party and the leader, for the country and the people. The young people and students rose up as one in response to the Supreme Commander’s order to enter a semi-war state; in little more than ten days, more than 1.5 million of them volunteered for enlistment in the People’s Army, and large numbers of ex-servicemen 357 and war veterans asked to be allowed to rejoin the army. We have become even more convinced through last year’s showdown with the enemy that there is no one in the world that would dare challenge us, and that we will emerge victorious from any trial as long as we have the great leader, the seasoned Party, the powerful People’s Army and the unbreakable single-hearted unity of the leader, the Party and the masses, and this has instilled confidence in the victory of socialism among the revolutionary people around the world. Last year was indeed the year of the severest trial and of the most brilliant victory in the annals of our Party. This year, too, we should expect another fierce struggle. Although the US imperialists were compelled to hold talks with us and sign the DPRK-USA Joint Statement, in which they promised to suspend the Team Spirit joint military exercise, there is no knowing what military adventures they may yet resort to. Until last year, they used to threaten us by staging the Team Spirit joint military exercise in March and April; now they may stage a military exercise under a different name in July or August. The enemy, having failed to bring us to submission by force of arms, is engaged in an appeasement policy, which is nothing but an insidious scheme to fragment our revolutionary position from within. We must not harbour any illusions about this appeasement policy: We must maintain our revolutionary vigilance more than ever before and step up the revolution and construction so as to develop our Juche-based strength in every way. We must struggle by remaining more vigilant and consolidate our revolutionary position so that the US imperialists dare not challenge our socialism. In order to push forward the revolution and construction and defend our style of socialism that is centred on the masses amid the acute confrontation with the enemy, we should consistently build up the Party, consolidate the single-hearted unity of the whole society, and enhance the country’s economic and military potential. To this end, we should improve Party work. We should continue to direct great efforts to strengthening the single-hearted unity of the Party and the ranks of the revolution. 358 This is the main guarantee for consolidating the revolutionary position of socialism by building up the driving force of the revolution, and the crucial factor that will decide the success of the revolutionary cause of Juche and the destiny of socialism. The revolutionary cause of our Party that was pioneered and guided by Comrade Kim Il Sung has achieved a victorious advance by relying on the single-hearted unity of the Party and the revolutionary ranks. And we have frustrated the aggressive schemes of the US-led enemies and defended our style of socialism by dint of this unity. The might of this unity will enable us to overcome any trials and difficulties, however grim, and to defeat any enemy, however formidable. Our unity is a most powerful weapon, one that could be secured only by our Party, a Juche-based revolutionary party. In the future, too, we should stand up to the enemy and defend and accomplish our style of socialism by dint of this unity. Strengthening this unity is a pivotal task for our Party. What is important above all else in consolidating the unity of the Party and the revolutionary ranks is to transform our cadres along revolutionary lines. Cadres, who are the backbone of the Party and of the revolutionary ranks, are the commanding personnel of the revolution. The solidity and effectiveness of the Party and the revolutionary ranks are largely dependant on the cadres. Since the cadres decide everything, they should be transformed along revolutionary lines to be equipped with a revolutionary world outlook. This will enable us to solve all the problems that arise in the revolution and construction. The Party intends to make this year a year for transforming cadres along revolutionary lines and to undertake an intensive drive to transform them into ardent revolutionaries who cast in their lot with the Party, as well as into faithful servants of the people. We must make positive efforts to transform along revolutionary lines cadres at all levels, from those in central organs down to ri Party secretaries. An important aspect in this undertaking is to train all cadres to be faithful people who cast in their lot with the Party and remain faithful 359 to the ideology and leadership of the Party. This is the key to the development of the Party and the consolidation of the unity of the revolutionary ranks. Cadres must be the standard-bearers in supporting the Party and the leader. They should cast in their lot with the Party and remain faithful to it and the leader, resolved to die at their posts. To share one’s destiny with the Party and fight for the revolution until one dies at one’s post represents a valuable life and a source of honour for a revolutionary. Accepting the ideas and policies of the Party and carrying them out without condition is the duty of, and a revolutionary stand proper to, cadres. Otherwise, they cannot defend the ideas and policies of the Party or discharge their duties as the commanding personnel of the revolution. Cadres must never entertain any doubt about the Party’s policies or judge them according to their own way of thinking. They should acquire a revolutionary spirit of accepting the Party’s ideas and policies and carrying them out without condition. They should devote all their energy and knowledge to carrying out the Party’s policies and instructions. Cadres should refrain from such practices as abusing their authority, working in a bureaucratic manner and enjoying privileges. These practices alienate the masses from the Party and ultimately bring about the ruin of the Party and socialism. One of the main reasons why the former Soviet Union and the other socialist countries in Eastern Europe collapsed was that their cadres were guilty of such practices. We should approach any manifestation of cadres misusing their authority and seeking privileges, not as a matter of business but from a political point of view, and wage an uncompromising struggle to overcome them. In order to eliminate such practices among cadres as the abuse of authority, bureaucratic behaviour, the pursuit of privileges and corruption, we should ensure that they arm themselves with the spirit of serving the people with devotion. Only once they have acquired this spirit can they view themselves as servants of the people and live 360 and work as such. Only cadres who serve the people with devotion and share good times and bad with them can be loved and respected by the people and enjoy the trust of the Party. I am particularly pleased whenever I receive a report about cadres who are loved and respected by the people. Senior officials should be exemplary in consolidating their revolutionary identity. A Korean saying goes: Like upstream, like downstream. When senior officials who have further transformed themselves into revolutionaries make strong demands on their subordinates, the latter will follow their example. In transforming cadres along revolutionary lines, an ideological struggle is essential. Explanation and persuasion should be the main method of transforming the masses into revolutionaries, whereas the main method of transforming cadres into revolutionaries should be an ideological struggle. Whenever such practices as failing to carry out the Party’s ideas and policies unconditionally, abusing one’s authority, acting bureaucratically, enjoying privileges and being corrupt are revealed among cadres, we should nip them in the bud through an ideological struggle. Those who fail to remould themselves in a revolutionary way through an ideological struggle should be sent to labour-intensive fields to be trained through labour. Legal sanctions should also be applied; there is no alternative, other than to take legal action against those who infringe on the interests of the people because they regard themselves as superior beings in spite of the demands of the Party and despite undergoing an ideological struggle. Today, when the class and ideological struggles are being waged fiercely, we should not tolerate the slightest deviation among cadres. Party officials should not do anything that may undermine law enforcement. Some Party officials, on the excuse of giving Party guidance to law-enforcement institutions, have interfered unnecessarily in cases and, on one pretext or another, hindered the proper enforcement of the law. This is unacceptable. There can be no exceptions in law enforcement. Anyone who has violated the law 361 must be brought to justice. Party officials, if they have violated the law by behaving as if they were above and outside it, must be dealt with particularly strictly. Our Party is a party that is waging revolution, a party that is waging a struggle. Those who fail to implement the Party’s policies and who protect their own positions while living in idleness and becoming an object of public ridicule, are not qualified to remain among the ranks of cadres. All Party members should play the role of the hardcore and vanguard in consolidating the unity of the Party and the revolutionary ranks. When we train the millions of Party members in the way of one educating and leading ten, the ten one hundred, the one hundred one thousand, and the one thousand ten thousand, and when these Party members educate and lead the masses, we will be able to cement the single-hearted unity of the Party and the masses. In the work with Party members, efforts should be channelled into educating them to remain unfailingly loyal to the Party and upholding its leadership in the vanguard. In this respect, it is important to encourage Party members to emulate the high Party spirit of Ri In Mo. Ri In Mo has remained steadfast in his revolutionary outlook on the world and on the leader. He cherished his loyalty to the Party during his 34-year-long imprisonment in south Korea, and now back in the socialist homeland, he is still doing the same. In refusing to yield to the enemy’s torture and appeasement, he cherished his loyalty to the Party and the leader as an article of his revolutionary faith and obligation, true to the commitment he made to the Party, and today, although in poor health, he is still making efforts to prove himself worthy of the affection and consideration bestowed on him by the Party and the leader. A few days ago he sent me a poem and the lyrics of a song, which prove how pure are his approach and stand towards the Party and the leader and his Party spirit. Even though he was educated for only five years by the Party after the country’s liberation, he is a true revolutionary, in that his Party spirit is higher 362 than that of Party members who have been receiving Party education for 30 or 40 years. All Party members should strive to enhance their Party spirit, by comparing themselves to Ri In Mo. If Party members are to fulfil their duties with a high Party spirit, they should participate faithfully in the organizational life of the Party. They should have a correct view of the Party organization and take part sincerely in Party life. They should report to their organizations with good conscience concerning the occurrences in their work and life, and not be dismayed if their shortcomings are brought to the attention of their organizations. They should approach the Party organization with greater respect and deference than they do individual officials in high positions. We should continue to undertake the work of rallying the broad sections of the masses behind the Party. In our work with the masses, we should give priority to working with the basic sections of the masses and, at the same time, work more substantially with people with chequered backgrounds, true to the Party’s consistent policy. At present, it is extremely important that we work well with the intellectuals. The intellectuals are a constituent part of our Party and of our revolutionary ranks; they are a driving force of the revolutionary struggle and social progress. In order to strengthen the Party and the revolutionary ranks and move the revolution and construction forward vigorously, we should always direct close attention to our work with them. Our working class are currently striving to defend and develop our style of socialism with no complaint about the inconveniences they are suffering in life, but some of the intellectuals are not. We should see to it that all our intellectuals defend our style of socialism staunchly and add glory to it as our Party’s true companions, assistants and advisers. We should ensure that the intellectuals work with revolutionary awareness and conscience. The intellectuals are duty bound to defend the Party and promote socialist construction with their knowledge and expertise; if they regard their duty simply as an obligation, they will 363 be unable to fulfil it creditably. No one who does his work out of a sense of obligation can display revolutionary enthusiasm and creative activeness or devote himself wholeheartedly to the revolutionary work. Such an intellectual will not be successful in his work, and end up as a simple wage-earner. We should encourage our intellectuals to devote their knowledge, expertise, talents and energy to carrying out their revolutionary tasks for the Party and the revolution, for the country and the people with revolutionary awareness and conscience. We should be discreet in our work with the intellectuals, taking their characters into consideration. They are knowledgeable about the situation and intelligent, and also very sensitive. Since they are educated people, we should inspire them to be loyal to and follow the Party and the leader of their own accord. We will not get them to follow the Party sincerely if we accuse them on political charges without consideration and criticize them harshly for their mistakes. The education of intellectuals should be done by means of explanation and persuasion. But this does not mean that we should indulge them. If, as a result of forsaking their revolutionary convictions and obligations, they commit acts that are detrimental to the Party and the revolution, they should be taken to task promptly. We should prepare the young people as advance guards who are faithful to the Party and the revolutionary cause. Today our young people are sound in their ideas and spirit. They are working miracles and performing great exploits in difficult and labour-intensive fields, true to the Party’s call, and are living and working with a firm resolve to be human rifles and bombs in safeguarding the Party. We must not slight the education of the young people, not even for a moment. The lesson of those countries where socialism has collapsed teaches us that the education of the young people is a serious matter that decides the destiny of the country. We must educate our young people well so that they live and work in a revolutionary manner, cherishing their loyalty to the Party and the leader. We should ensure that they are not tainted with reactionary and decadent bourgeois modes of life, that they are not enthralled by 364 money or abandon themselves to bourgeois fashions, that in their outward appearance, such as their clothing, they conform to the demands of the era of revolution and our national customs, and that they sing revolutionary and ennobling songs, dance sound dance pieces and voluntarily abide by public morals. We should produce tape recordings of revolutionary songs, songs about life and dance music for the young people. If we distribute a lot of cassettes of revolutionary songs, songs about life and dance music, it will help to prevent the infiltration of corrupt bourgeois and revisionist art and to create a revolutionary and optimistic climate in society. The League of Socialist Working Youth organizations should undertake the education of the young people in a responsible manner. The LSWY should direct its efforts to the education of the young people in a communist way instead of only involving itself in shock campaigns, such as the youth shock brigade movement. In particular, it should pay close attention to the education of the young people in border and frontline areas. Families, schools and workshops, too, should educate and lead them to live and work in a revolutionary manner. Ideological education should be intensified, as demanded by the current situation and the developing reality. In our country today ideological education can be likened to our revolutionary lifeline. Intensifying ideological education is a fundamental guarantee for defending and adding glory to our style of socialism. All Party organizations should, with the main emphasis on encouraging cadres, Party members and other working people to cherish their loyalty to the Party and the leader as an article of faith, conscience, morality and everyday concern, conduct various forms of education in a more substantial manner, such as education in the principles of the Juche idea, in Party policy, in our revolutionary traditions, in class consciousness, in revolutionary optimism, in socialist patriotism, and in communist morality, along with antirevisionist education. Education by means of positive examples is effective in 365 ideological education. In our country today many people display the beautiful communist virtues of devoting their bodies and souls, and even their youth and lives, without hesitation, to the Party, the revolution, the society, the collective, and their comrades. Many young people have become life companions of disabled exservicemen or ex-servicewomen, and many are bringing up orphans or are taking care of old people with no family to support them; these are examples of communist virtue, the like of which can be witnessed only in our country. We should give publicity in various forms and by various methods to such examples. We should act radically to get rid of formalism in ideological education. To all intents and purposes, ideological education should be conducted in a realistic and fresh manner based on facts, so that it can touch the heartstrings of the people. We should wage a vigorous struggle against non-socialist practices. Non-socialist practices such as the observance of superstition, delinquency, graft and bribery are extremely harmful, in that they eat away at the ideological, spiritual and moral foundations of the socialist system. People who are guilty of such practices may be used by the enemy in their anti-socialist schemes. We must never ignore such practices and must launch an intensive onslaught to root it out. We must identify non-socialist practices promptly and take resolute action against them. Ideological education and ideological struggle are important in this, but legal sanctions should also be applied with appropriate severity. The judicial, public security and procuratorial organs should enhance their role in the struggle against non-socialist practices. We should conduct effective organizational and political work in order to implement the revolutionary economic strategy of the Party. At the 21st Plenary Meeting of the Sixth Party Central Committee and in his New Year Address this year, the great leader defined the next two or three years as a period of adjustment, and he assigned 366 tasks for implementing the agriculture-first, light-industry-first and foreign-trade-first policy, while giving definite priority to the coal industry, the power industry and rail transport, the vanguards of the national economy, and developing the metal industry without letup. The revolutionary economic strategy of the Party reflects its firm determination and will to improve the people’s standard of living radically in the near future and develop the national economy into an economy with a strong Juche character that will remain unaffected, no matter what economic sanctions the imperialists may enforce. By carrying out this strategy, we should build up the might of our style of socialism and give full play to its advantages. All Party organizations and Party officials should conduct positive organizational and political work for rousing Party members and other working people to carry out the economic strategy so as to adorn this year, the first year of the adjustment period, as a year in which a fresh turn is made in building the socialist economy. We should see to it that leading economic officials improve their sense of responsibility and role in economic work. Recently, the Party took the step of concentrating all economic affairs in the hands of the Administration Council in order to provide the Party’s comprehensive monolithic leadership to the economy and get economic officials to carry out their economic work on their full responsibility. While combating the tendency of Party officials to take administrative and economic affairs upon themselves, Party organizations should resist the tendency among leading economic officials to take things easy because they think Party workers will perform their administrative and economic tasks. Party organizations should guard against the tendency to disrupt the work of leading economic officials and should ensure that these officials do their best to perform their economic tasks responsibly. For this purpose, Party organizations should give prominence to leading economic officials and establish strict administrative discipline. They should see to it that cadres, Party members and other working people implement administrative directives without 367 condition and with a correct view on them, and combat the tendency to pick quarrels and haggle over them. We should display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude at a high level in carrying out the Party’s revolutionary economic strategy. Today, when the imperialists are further intensifying their economic blockade in an effort to stifle socialism in our country, the only way of pushing forward the socialist economic construction is to display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. We should overcome the hardships and obstacles on the way of building the socialist economy by dint of this revolutionary spirit. Party organizations and Party officials should educate cadres, Party members and other working people in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, as displayed in the days of the antiJapanese revolutionary struggle, the Fatherland Liberation War and post-war reconstruction, so that they work with a high degree of ideological preparedness in carrying out their revolutionary tasks by themselves regardless of whether help is forthcoming from their superiors or not. All sectors and units should be encouraged to conduct a campaign to tap into latent resources. If we enlist our latent resources, we will be able to produce and construct more in the present conditions. The producer masses and officials know where latent resources lie. Recently economic researchers at the Academy of Social Sciences suggested that, if the supply of vegetables for kimchi pickling was organized by residential areas, and not by work units, a great deal of oil, trucks and labour could be saved. If all sectors and units study hard as the academy did, a rich vein of latent resources can be tapped. Party organizations and officials should go deep among the scientists, technicians and producer masses, and conduct organizational and political work to discover all our latent resources. We should continue to channel a major effort into strengthening the country’s defences. Because we are standing in direct confrontation with the US imperialists, we should not neglect even for a moment the work of 368 strengthening the country’s defences. Party organizations should ensure that all the servicemen and people carry out the military line of the Party and prepare themselves fully to cope with any provocation by the enemy. We should further reinforce the People’s Army. It is only when the People’s Army is strong that we can repulse the enemy’s aggression and defend the revolutionary cause of our Party and socialist country. The might of the People’s Army is manifested above all in its political and ideological superiority. We should prepare our servicemen as ardent revolutionary fighters who would sacrifice their lives without hesitation for the sake of the Party, the leader, the country and the people. The Party organizations and other political organs in the People’s Army should conduct substantial political work so that all our servicemen, as revolutionary fighters under arms, discharge their honourable duty with loyalty to the Party and the leader, with devotion to the country and the people and with hatred for the class enemy. Party’s political work in the army should be consistent with the specific characteristics of the military, and not done in the same way as it is in society. Party’s political work in the People’s Army should be conducted with the main emphasis on imbuing all the servicemen with the revolutionary soldier spirit–the spirit of dedicating one’s youth and life without hesitation for the sake of the Party and the leader and carrying out the orders of the Supreme Commander in the spirit of self-sacrifice. A revolutionary and militant climate should be created in the People’s Army, by which the entire army accepts and executes without condition the orders of the Supreme Commander, obeys military orders without question and works and lives in accordance with military discipline. To display the traditional trait of unity between the army and the people at a high level is very important in reinforcing the People’s Army and bringing it to full combat readiness. When the army and the people form an inseparable whole, with the army helping the 369 people and the people aiding the army, the People’s Army will develop into an invincible military force and emerge victorious in the battle with the enemy. All Party organizations should lead the people to attach great importance to military affairs, to love the servicemen as they would their own kith and kin, and to assist them wholeheartedly. Party organizations should ensure that regular assistance is rendered to the People’s Army, while guarding against any deviation in this work. To develop a self-supporting defence industry is an important matter that is related to the destiny of the country and socialism. Had we not built a self-supporting defence industry capable of producing a variety of modern weaponry, our country would have long ago been occupied by the enemy. However severe the strain on the country’s economic situation, we should never neglect munitions production. We should give effective Party guidance to developing the defence industry and performing supply work for this sector. The policy of fortifying the whole country and arming all the people should be carried out, so as to turn the whole country into an impregnable fortress. In order to carry out the revolutionary tasks facing the Party successfully, we should enhance the functions and role of Party organizations at all levels so as to make them militant organizations that perform their work with the people from a fresh approach. Only then will a new change take place in Party work and a revolutionary upsurge be achieved in all sectors and units. Several Party organizations are guilty of mixing Party work with administrative and economic work, and are still performing administrative work themselves; this has resulted in the work with the people and Party guidance to administrative and economic work becoming ineffective. In order to ensure that Party organizations get out of the habit of taking over administrative and economic work and place emphasis on the work with the people, the Party has recently taken steps to reform its machinery. All Party organizations should do Party work, work with the people, true to the intentions of the Party. 370 A proper system of working with lower Party organizations should be established. Currently, several senior Party officials are working only on the basis of reports compiled by members of their staff, and are thus going over the heads of the leading officials in the Party organizations they deal with. Senior Party officials should work with their subordinate Party organizations not by relying only on their staff, but by approaching the leading officials of these Party organizations directly. They should pay regular visits to the units they deal with and help and lead their Party organizations and Party officials to work with the people on a substantial basis. The organizational and information departments of Party committees at all levels should enhance their role. The organizational department should take control of and guide the activities of lower Party organizations and the Party life of cadres and other Party members. The information department should give political guidance to the organs it deals with in accordance with its functions, without interfering in their business affairs. The two departments should rid themselves of their departmentalism and launch combined operations, discussing together the problems that arise in Party work in detail and solving them through a joint effort. By undertaking Party work effectively as the Party intends, all Party organizations and Party officials should further consolidate the revolutionary position of socialism and bring about a fresh upsurge in the revolution and construction.",new dwell problem party need tackle last grim history party attempt isolate suffocate bastion socialism imperialist last resort unprecedented machination

16.10.1994,Kim Jong Il,"One hundred days have passed since the death of the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung. During these days our people have felt even more keenly how great he was and how much they were blessed by having him as their leader. We admired him for his greatness in his lifetime, and his greatness becomes even more conspicuous in death. Comrade Kim Il Sung was the great leader whom our people held in high esteem for the first time in their history of thousands of years, and the sun of humankind who was looked up to by the whole world. Having embarked on the road of revolution in his early years, he devoted his all to the people’s freedom and welfare, overcoming every manner of hardship. And, with the absolute support and trust of our people and of the progressive people the world over he led the revolution to victory, accomplishing immortal exploits that will shine in history. He led our Party and people for half a century after Korea’s liberation, not to mention the period when he led the antiJapanese revolutionary struggle. Had he lived one year longer, he would have witnessed the celebration of the 50th anniversaries of Korea’s liberation and the founding of the Workers’ Party of Korea. No leader anywhere in the world has led his party, state 388 and people for 50 years and created such shining achievements as Comrade Kim Il Sung did. His immortal exploits in achieving the victory of the cause of the independence of the masses, the cause of socialism, constitute the greatest achievements in the history of humankind and the international communist movement. He was truly a great philosopher, statesman, military strategist and artist of leadership, who glorified modern history with his outstanding ideas and theories and wise leadership. We must feel very proud that we were led by such a great man. Comrade Kim Il Sung was also an outstanding revolutionary, a great man and the benevolent father of the people. He trained our people into excellent people, established our advantageous socialist system and worked energetically to the last moment of his life to provide our people with still greater happiness. He treasured the people, regarding them as his God, and had everything honourable named after the “people”–the names of the state, of the armed forces, of a palace of culture, of a study house and of hospitals. He was infinitely gracious and humble. On July 6, he telephoned me and told me about the problems arising in north-south relations, and asked me the Party’s opinion. When I answered that the Party would do as he resolved, he said he would act in the belief that he had the Party’s approval. That was the last time he called me. He completed all his work before his death, as if he had foreseen what was to happen. Although he was in his eighties, he has in recent years met all the surviving veterans of the anti-Japanese revolution and the orphaned sons and daughters of the martyrs of the south Korean revolution and other martyrs. When writing his memoirs, he recalled everyone who had been associated with his revolutionary struggle, and met not only those in the country but also those who live abroad. Whenever he met the bereaved sons and daughters of revolutionary martyrs and those associated with his career, he would say that he owed his good health to me and asked them to support me loyally. He presented them with wrist watches and showed them every manner of affection and kindness. 389 He posed for souvenir photographs on numerous occasions. This year alone he posed with the participants in the National Meeting of Agriculture and the National Meeting of Workers in the Coal-Mining Industry, as well as with numerous other working people. This year he met officials in various sectors and gave them valuable instructions. On April 25, he met commanding officers of the Korean People’s Army and gave them instructions for strengthening the armed forces. It was his last behest to the army. That day he said that the army should loyally support its Supreme Commander. This year he presided over several consultative meetings of leading agricultural officials, and on July 5 and 6, just before his death, he convened a consultative meeting of senior officials in the economic sector and gave them instructions to be strictly followed in socialist economic construction. This year he conducted energetic activities in the external field, meeting many foreigners; he met former US President Jimmy Carter and created favourable conditions for us in the DPRK-USA talks. In his lifetime, he brought every problem to a perfect solution, with the exception of that of national reunification. Even so, he laid down solid foundations for the early resolution of the problem of national reunification. He said that the Korean nation, though divided at present, would lead a happy life in a reunified country before long. Thus he died after completing his work in all spheres and leaving a lingering influence in the hearts of the Korean people and of the revolutionary people the world over. No other leader in the world has ever completed all his work prior to his death. Comrade Kim Il Sung died of heart disease. He had suffered from heart disease for several years, but we kept the state of his health from the people, lest they should worry about him. This year, he was suffering from eye trouble, so he read the manuscript of his New Year Address with difficulty. He underwent an eye operation. Even a young man must rest for at least a month after such an operation. However, a few days after the operation, he met Son Won Thae, and had a photograph taken with the participants in the Fifth Congress of the Children’s Union of 390 Korea. Subsequently he met Carter and other foreign dignitaries on their visit to our country. He was working to a tight schedule, formulating the political and economic issues our side would present at the north-south summit, going over the many documents that were submitted to him and giving on-the-spot guidance to farms in Onchon County and on the outskirts of Pyongyang. Although he had been suffering from heart disease for several years, he never stopped working. Because he worked with such a superhuman effort even at the advanced age of 80-plus, his condition went from bad to worse. There can have been no other leader in the world who worked so dynamically even in his eighties right up until his death, as he did. Since he worked so hard for the benefit of the people right up until his sudden death, our people feel even more heartbroken. He worked with vigour for the Party and the revolution, the country and his fellow people until he died in his office. He died at his post. He is the only leader in the world who completed his work through energetic activities right up until the last moment of his life. In view of this, he was the greatest of great men. He was a great leader, a great revolutionary and a great man beyond comparison with all other great men. His great traits and great image, characterized by his brilliant ideas and theories, his unexcelled leadership, his noble virtues, his outstanding personality, his informal manner and his frugal life, have moved the world’s people and presented to them the image of the most outstanding man in history. As the days go by, we feel more keenly that he was inherently a great man. We must have many books about his greatness written to inform our contemporaries and posterity about it. Our people’s boundless loyalty to and reverence for him has been more evident since his death. They have, by displaying their noble spiritual and moral traits to the full, conveyed the feeling that they will not forget the gratitude they owe him for providing them with genuine happiness. In bitter grief over his death and with an earnest longing for him, our people have visited statues of him by day and at night. They have 391 all mourned him and paid great tribute to his memory with full honour. A few days after his death, while I was touring Pyongyang, I drove to his statue on Mansu Hill. There I saw numerous citizens, in spite of the rain, extending their condolences to the deceased in the concourse in front of the statue, and many others awaiting their turn at the foot of the steps leading up to the concourse. Among them were five university students who were waiting their turn to lay a wreath of flowers; although they were soaked to the skin, they were covering the wreath with their shirts to keep it from getting wet. I gazed at them for a while, and shed tears; all I could think was, these are the students of the new generation. Today on my way back from the meeting of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee after the national memorial service on the occasion of the 100th day following Comrade Kim Il Sung’s death, I saw some housewives who had attended the ceremony, requesting to be allowed into the Kumsusan Assembly Hall. They apparently were doing so out of their unquenchable desire to see the late leader. Last night when I went to Mansu Hill during my tour of Pyongyang, I saw endless crowds of people visiting the leader’s statue, in spite of the rain. I was so sorry to see them exposed to the cold rain that I called an official and told him to dissuade the people from doing so. During the mourning period, our people demonstrated their high moral standards to the world. I was greatly moved by the noble morality of our people in holding their deceased leader in such high esteem. Our people are truly a noble people who are incomparable to any other people in the world with regard to the ideological, spiritual and moral qualities with which they support their leader. They are highly laudable. The world will never know another people as excellent as ours. Our people are our blessing. It is because we have these excellent people that we can defend socialism in confrontation with the allied forces of imperialism. Even our enemy, not to mention the progressive people of the world, express admiration at the loyalty and filial devotion with which our people follow their leader. Some 392 businessmen and specialists from a capitalist country, who had been in our country during the mourning period, were interviewed by journalists upon their return home. In the interview, they said that all the Korean people cherished unqualified reverence for the late President Kim Il Sung and wailed with bitterest grief over his death, and that they had never seen such people anywhere else. CNN International and NHK broadcast the scenes of the Korean people expressing their heartfelt regret and indescribable grief over the President’s death. Now, the world is speaking highly of our people’s spiritual and moral qualities. The enemy, when they see the noble ideological and spiritual qualities of our people who are unfailingly faithful to the Party and the leader, are afraid of us because we have such excellent people. In the documentary film The Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung Is Immortal, the enemy can see not only images of Korean people in their grief but also the might of their single-hearted unity. The might of the single-hearted unity of our people is greater than that of an atomic bomb. No enemy, however formidable, and no weaponry, however advanced, will prevail over such people as ours who are infinitely loyal to the Party and the leader. Our people are a great people. We should use the adjective “great” in describing our people. I am very grateful to our people for expressing their condolences over the passing of the late leader with such bitter grief. That we are blessed with such people is thanks to Comrade Kim Il Sung. He placed great political trust in us and appointed us to important posts of the Party and the state. He edified our people and brought them up to be an excellent people with a proper attitude towards their leader and Party. Always mindful of his achievements in this, and with a sense of great pride and honour in having such an excellent people, we should serve them more faithfully. We should conduct education among cadres, Party members and other working people so that they consummate the revolutionary cause of the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung in the belief that he is always with us. 393 Although his heart has stopped beating, he is with our people as ever. As the brain of the unity of the leader, the Party and the masses and as the sun of the nation, he is immortal. It can be said that his history will continue as the country grows prosperous, as he wished in his lifetime. We should hold him in high esteem through the ages and undertake all work as he did. The founder of our nation was Tangun, and the founder of socialist Korea was Comrade Kim Il Sung. Without him, we could not conceive of Korea today, shining over the world, or of the great dignity, honour and pride of the Korean nation. He is the great father of the nation; under his leadership the Korean nation has become the most dignified and happiest nation in the world. Overseas Koreans call their nation Kim Il Sung’s nation. We should work with greater devotion to enhance the dignity of the nation that is named after him. Without this national dignity, we may repeat the history of worshipping big countries and suffering humiliation. We should ensure that all cadres, Party members and other working people give fuller play to the Korean-nation-first spirit, taking pride in having built the most advantageous people-centred, Korean-style socialism under his leadership. We should add eternal glory to Comrade Kim Il Sung’s great ideology, cause and undying exploits by displaying a noble moral outlook. The moral quality of communists finds concentrated expression in holding their leader in high regard. Some people are of the opinion that new Party and state leadership bodies should be formed right away, now that the President has passed away, but this cannot and need not be done. In view of the noble moral outlook with which we hold him in high esteem, we cannot rush such a reorganization. As you can see in the documentary The Great Life in 1994, Comrade Kim Il Sung vigorously conducted his last revolutionary activities in 1994, refusing to rest even for a moment. In view of this, we should make the rest of the year a mourning period. In olden times, our ancestors 394 mourned a death for a period of 100 days or a year or three years. We should form the new leadership after the work has been completed of preserving his body. It is not appropriate for new Party and state leadership bodies to be formed and hailed while the people, in their grief, are still lamenting at his bier. Since our political system is based on the single-hearted unity of the leader, the Party and the masses, it will never waver. The People’s Army is boundlessly loyal to its Supreme Commander, and the people are also demonstrating undivided loyalty to their leader. Our people, who are more solidly rallied behind the Party without the slightest vacillation since Comrade Kim Il Sung’s death, are persevering to consummate the revolutionary cause of Juche that he pioneered. In the mourning period the solid single-hearted unity of the leader, the Party and the masses fully demonstrated its solidity; the creation of this unity is one of the great achievements of Comrade Kim Il Sung. If he had not built up the driving force of the revolution and constructed socialism of the Korean style by realizing this unity, we would not have been able to surmount the current difficulties. Because the People’s Army is boundlessly loyal to its Supreme Commander, the Party maintains a harmonious whole with the masses and the leadership system of the Party is firm, we need not hurry over forming new leadership bodies. Instead of concerning ourselves with the formation of a new leadership, we should think about how to safeguard the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered by Comrade Kim Il Sung and carry it forward successfully. We must follow only the road of revolution that he travelled and concentrate all our efforts on carrying out his cause. A communist should seek satisfaction in waging the revolution regardless of his post. Comrade Kim Il Sung did not have in mind the posts of party general secretary and head of state after Korea’s liberation when he was leading the anti-Japanese revolution in his early years at the head of the Korean revolution. He waged the bloody anti-Japanese revolution for some 20 years simply to liberate the country and provide the people with freedom and happiness. 395 I have always considered myself to be one of his men. I will carry forward his revolutionary cause as his loyal man as I did in his lifetime. Our pledge after his demise cannot differ from the one we made in his lifetime; we must remain true to our noble moral obligations as his revolutionary fighters. As the days go by, our people are longing for him more eagerly, visiting his statues to lay wreaths and flowers and to pay tribute to him. I ensured that the mourning period was prolonged in line with the people’s wishes, so that they could continue to extend their condolences. In the mourning period our people have nurtured the conviction that Comrade Kim Il Sung is always with them. We must ensure that they hold him in high esteem forever and remain faithful to his will. If we undertake the work of holding him in high esteem for eternity, we can exert a significant influence on establishing a true communist moral outlook in the international communist movement. Communist morality is pure, noble and genuine. The core of communist morality is loyalty to the leader. In the past revisionists such as Khrushchev who appeared in the international communist movement, seriously undermined communist morality. Khrushchev, by slandering Stalin, gave the negative impression to the world that communists were ignorant of their forerunners in the revolution and fought one another. Lenin, the founder of the first socialist state, is today slandered by the renegade socialists, seventy years after his death. Similar phenomena have been witnessed in other parties in the international communist movement. As a result, the communists lost the people’s trust and support, and this ended with the collapse of socialism in several countries. By holding Comrade Kim Il Sung in high esteem forever, even more so than we did in his lifetime, we should demonstrate to the world the outlook on morality with which communists support their leaders. Thus we can actively contribute to safeguarding and adding glory to the noblest communist morality and to its worldwide rehabilitation, after it was marred by the revisionists and renegades of socialism. 396 Those who took the floor at today’s national memorial service pledged to carry forward as ever the revolutionary cause of Juche that was pioneered by Comrade Kim Il Sung. The armed forces and the people should struggle vigorously in pursuance of this pledge. We should safeguard and glorify his great revolutionary exploits as we did in his lifetime and carry out the revolution and construction at all times as he intended and as he did. By faithfully carrying forward the socialist cause, the revolutionary cause of Juche that he hewed out, we will demonstrate the Korean communists’ noble moral outlook. At the same time as we are setting fine examples for the revolutionary people of the world in political, ideological, moral and all other fields, we must produce a lot of literature on the subject. I am currently writing a treatise, titled, Socialism Is a Science. I intend to publish it in November or December this year. We must not only defend and develop socialism of our own style, but also intensify our theoretical information work so as to offer encouragement to the people who aspire after socialism. Edification through documentary films should be conducted in an effective manner. Documentaries are an effective means of ideological education. Such films help Party members and other working people recognize the greatness of their leader. Recently, several documentaries, including parts one, two and three of The Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung Is Immortal, and The Great Life in 1994 were produced. We should make arrangements for these films to be shown for educational purposes. When The Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung Is Immortal was produced, the officials concerned proposed organizing showings of the three parts of the film. I ensured that the first part was shown initially, and that the second and third parts were shown on the occasion of the memorial service marking the 100th day after his death. Showing the film in such a way has proved effective in educating Party members and other working people. When the documentary The Great Life in 1994 was in the production stage, I ensured that the voice of Comrade 397 Kim Il Sung was inserted in the scene in which he is speaking at a consultative meeting of senior officials in the economic sector on July 6, 1994. This is the first documentary in which his voice appears. I was told that cadres, Party members and other working people were very moved to hear his voice when they watched the film. This shows that documentaries serve as a powerful means of educating Party members and other working people. The first and second parts of the documentary President Kim Il Sung Meets Foreign Heads of State and Prominent Figures have been produced. The subsequent parts will also be produced. From the day of Korea’s liberation until his death Comrade Kim Il Sung met over 70 000 foreign figures, including heads of state. No other leader in the world has ever met so many foreign figures. How good it would have been if we had produced the documentary in his lifetime so that he could see it! We should make arrangements for these documentaries to be shown to cadres, Party members and other working people so that they fully realize his greatness and hold him in high esteem through the ages. The documentary President Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il Were Always Together on the Road for the Well-Being of the People contains scenes of Comrade Kim Il Sung and myself working together. In the film there is a scene in which Comrade Kim Il Sung sings Nostalgia. It is a song he used to sing in the days of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. Once he sang a Chinese song, Song of Su Wu, which he also used to sing in those days. In his memoirs With the Century he recollected that song with deep emotion. The song reflects the patriotic sentiments of the Chinese people. After Korea’s liberation he sought out the text of the song, and he finally obtained it just a few years ago. He was so delighted that he sang it. I have a tape recording of him singing Nostalgia and Song of Su Wu; it is something to treasure. It will be good if the scene of him singing Song of Su Wu is inserted in a documentary. Our people will be greatly moved to see him singing the song. Although it is a Chinese song, it will be all right to broadcast the scene because he was a great internationalist. 398 The Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble produced the song We Pledge after Comrade Kim Il Sung’s demise. I had it broadcast on the occasion of the 100th day after his death. The text of the song is clear and simple. The song sings about the will of our people to remain faithful to the Party’s cause to the last and make their country ever more prosperous, true to Comrade Kim Il Sung’s last behest. As the song says, we must make our country more prosperous by remaining faithful to his last will. Only by making our country more prosperous can we add lustre to our socialism and hasten national reunification. In order to safeguard Comrade Kim Il Sung’s revolutionary cause and accomplish it, we must strengthen the Party and consolidate the single-hearted unity of the leader, the Party and the masses. The Party is the destiny of the country, the nation and the people. The decisive guarantee of victory in the revolution lies in strengthening the Party and enhancing its leadership role. We should continue to direct great efforts to building up the Party organizationally and ideologically and thus make it invincible. We should, first of all, build up the Party ranks and cement its unity and cohesion centred on the leader by conducting effective organizational work. We should prevent any alien element from infiltrating our Party ranks and any negative factor, however negligible, from undermining its unity and cohesion. Along with organizational work, Party ideological work should be conducted in a substantial manner. Education in the Juche idea constitutes the essence of ideological education among Party members and other working people. The Juche idea is the only ideology guiding our revolution and construction, and it is the lifeline of the Korean people. If our people are truly to exist, they must firmly equip themselves with the Juche idea and follow the road indicated by it. By conducting education in the Juche idea in a more effective manner, we can ensure that all Party members and other working people arm themselves firmly with the idea, accept it as their unshakeable conviction and make positive efforts to apply it in practice. It is important in strengthening the Party and enhancing its 399 leadership role to establish the leadership system of the Party. The development of the Party and the victorious advance of the revolution and construction are inconceivable apart from the system in which the entire Party, all the people and the whole army move as one under the unified guidance of the Party Central Committee. We should consolidate the monolithic leadership system of the Party and create in the entire Party and the whole society a revolutionary habit of accepting and carrying out the Party’s lines and policies unreservedly. We should continue to develop the single-hearted unity of the leader, the Party and the masses, a weapon with which we will emerge victorious in the confrontation with the enemy. This unity will make us a match for any enemy, however formidable, and enable us to surmount any trial and emerge victorious. We should continue to develop this unity in depth, so as to rally all the people more firmly around the Party and the leader and by dint of this unity overcome the trials on the road of revolution. We should channel great efforts into economic work. Although nearly a year has passed since a new revolutionary economic strategy was adopted at the 21st Plenary Meeting of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party, economic work is not being conducted with the vigour that the Party demands. The revolutionary economic strategy of the Party is, in essence, a strategy for developing agriculture and light industry, and for improving the people’s standard of living. The most conspicuous shortcoming in the implementation of this strategy is the failure to grasp the main link in the whole chain, and this is due to efforts being dispersed and too many construction projects being undertaken. Comrade Kim Il Sung worried about economic work until the last moment of his life. We should implement the Party’s economic strategy by any means and put his lifetime wish into reality. We should, by strictly adhering to this strategy, carry out the agriculturefirst policy, light-industry-first policy and foreign-trade-first policy and thus rapidly improve the people’s standard of living. The commissions and ministries of the Administration Council and the 400 departments of the Party Central Committee should orient their work to carrying out these tasks and, in particular, focus their efforts on agriculture and light industry. The Administration Council and the State Planning Commission should reexamine the overall national economic plan and amend it to facilitate the implementation of the economic strategy. The plan should be mapped out along the line of concentrating all our efforts on agriculture and light industry in reflection of the main targets and requirements of the economic strategy, so as to improve the people’s standard of living radically. Without focusing on agriculture and light industry, we can neither improve the people’s standard of living quickly nor maintain our existence. In order to support agriculture and light industry, we should also direct efforts to the vanguard sectors in the national economy, principally the power industry. Without electricity, we can neither produce fertilizer nor farm well nor run our light-industry factories at full capacity. And, based on a feasibility study of the projects that are now under construction, we should suspend the infeasible ones and divert the equipment, materials and funds to agriculture and light industry. In order to implement the revolutionary economic strategy of the Party, the Administration Council should enhance its role. The Administration Council is the economic headquarters that organizes and commands the overall economic work of the country in a unified manner; it is answerable to the Party on economic matters. Success in economic work depends on how the Administration Council works. The Party has established a system by which the Administration Council assumes full responsibility for economic affairs and performs the central role in the economic sphere, and has created favourable conditions for it to do its work so that it can undertake economic work as the economic headquarters of the country. The Administration Council, fully aware of the Party’s intention, must apply the system thoroughly and organize and command the country’s economic work with a high sense of responsibility. All economic bodies, including the commissions and ministries of the 401 Administration Council, should bring any problems that arise in economic work to the attention of the Administration Council and solve them under its unified command. If a fresh upsurge is to be achieved in economic work, officials must give full play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. It is true that there are some difficulties in economic work, but they can be surmounted if officials work hard in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. One thing Comrade Kim Il Sung used to emphasize in his lifetime was the revolutionary spirit of selfreliance and fortitude. I ensured that, during the mourning period, officials inspected the cooperative farms on the Yonbaek Plain, the Jonchon County Commercial Management Agency and Maengsan County as a way of encouraging them to implement the Party’s revolutionary economic strategy thoroughly and perform the work of their own units well by displaying the revolutionary spirit of selfreliance and fortitude. The Jonchon County Commercial Management Agency and Maengsan County are model units; they have been working well, in the spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. The provinces should strive to emulate the example of Maengsan County, and in the commercial field the Jong Chun Sil movement, which aims at following the example of the Jonchon County Commercial Management Agency, should be conducted more vigorously. In view of the great importance of officials displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, I emphasized it at today’s meeting of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee. Leading economic officials in every sector and at every unit should, based on a clear understanding of the Party’s intention, fulfil the economic tasks assigned to them by displaying the revolutionary spirit of selfreliance and fortitude. We should strengthen the People’s Army and create a climate in which prominence is given to military affairs throughout society. We are waging a revolution in direct confrontation with the US imperialists, the chieftain of the world’s reactionaries, and have yet to accomplish national reunification. The road of our revolution is beset 402 with many trials and obstacles, and the US imperialists and reactionaries are intensifying their moves of aggression and war against our country. In these circumstances, if we are to overcome all the trials and hardships facing us and safeguard and advance the socialist cause, we must resolutely strengthen the army as well as the Party. Without strengthening the army, we cannot defend the gains of the revolution, step up socialist construction or accomplish the reunification of the country. What is important in strengthening the army at present is to make it boundlessly loyal to the cause of the Party. Our People’s Army is the army of the Party. The People’s Army as the army of the Party must hold high the red flag, the flag of the Workers’ Party of Korea. That it fights bravely and in defiance of death for the cause of the Party constitutes the essential feature and is the source of the invincibility of the People’s Army. The army must remain loyal to the cause of the Party, whatever the adversity, and establish the revolutionary trait of sharing destiny with the Party. For the sake of victory in the revolutionary struggle, the Party and the army should form an integral whole. Both are inseparably linked to each other; a party that fails to command the army cannot display its might, and an army that does not enjoy the party’s leadership cannot be a strong combat force. An army that is separated from the leadership of a party cannot win a revolutionary war. The military command system can bring the army into action but it cannot mobilize the civilian masses. It is the party that mobilizes broad sections of the masses. Only when the party and the army form an integral whole can the entire party, all the people and the whole army move as one. The revolutionary party, when the army defends it by force of arms, remains invincible; and the revolutionary army, when the revolutionary party guides it and enlists the masses, can display its formidable might. If the party and the army pool their strength they can defeat any enemy and emerge victorious in the revolutionary struggle. In this sense, it can be said that in our country today the Party is the army and the army is the Party. The People’s Army should create a revolutionary climate 403 within itself, based on the climate within the Party. The People’s Army should staunchly defend the Party, be loyal to its leadership and defend its cause by force of arms. We should ensure that relations between the army and the people are good, since they are a key link in the preparedness for combat. Unless they are united in one mind and one will, they cannot defeat the enemy. We must give free rein to the traditional traits of unity between the army and the people so that in times of emergency they will defeat the aggressors and defend the socialist homeland, united in one mind and one will. We should create a climate in which prominence is given to military affairs throughout society. By doing so, we can ensure that all the people love and support the army and make the country a “porcupine” by placing all the people under arms and fortifying the whole country. Combat sports should be developed. As our country is in direct confrontation with the enemy, we must develop such sports as shooting and boxing. Achieving national reunification is of great importance in accomplishing Comrade Kim Il Sung’s cause and implementing his last will. He, more than anyone else, grieved over the nation’s division, and he directed unremitting efforts to the cause of national reunification. He wished for reunification with such fervour, but he died before its realization. One of his last wishes was national reunification; he wanted to see the whole nation enjoying a harmonious life in a reunified country. We should achieve, at any cost, the historic cause of national reunification for which he wished so fervently, and thus fulfil his desire. We must continue the struggle to bring back the unconverted longterm prisoners from south Korea. Because of the country’s division, many people are undergoing hardship in the south. The unconverted long-term prisoners in the south are waging an active struggle to return to the north. We should, come what may, bring back the many unconverted long-term prisoners from the south. 404 In order to safeguard and consummate the revolutionary cause of Comrade Kim Il Sung, we should hold fast to the principle of independence. Political independence is a major hallmark of a sovereign state, and adhering to the principle of independence is the main guarantee for winning victory in the revolution. It is because we have firmly adhered to our independence that we have been able to defend socialism without the slightest vacillation under the difficult and complex situation created by the continuing vicious moves by the imperialists and reactionaries. Lack of independence leads a country to ruin. The Eastern European socialist countries imploded because, lacking political independence, they acted according to the dictates of big countries. Just as we did in the past, so in the future, too, we should strictly adhere to independence in all spheres of Party and state activities. We must hold fast to the independent foreign policy of our Party. In the whole course of leading the revolution and construction, Comrade Kim Il Sung always followed an independent foreign policy. In the past, big-power chauvinists tried to pressure our country into joining the Warsaw Pact and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA). Comrade Kim Il Sung, however, did not bow to the pressure, and instead adhered to independence. Our country was absolutely right to have refused to join the Warsaw Pact and the CMEA. If we had joined these organizations, there is no knowing what disaster might have befallen us. Comrade Kim Il Sung was, indeed, a remarkably far-sighted leader of the revolution and construction. We should, in the future, too, adhere to an independent and principled foreign policy, true to his will, and thus defend our national dignity and consolidate international solidarity with our revolution. Long ago, the Party proclaimed the slogans “Let us live our own way!” and “Let us give fuller play to the Korean-nation-first spirit!” No other slogans could be more readily accepted by us. We should, by holding higher the banner of the Juche idea, adhere to the principle of independence, and at all times live our own way.",hundred day pass since death leader sung during these day feel

31.12.1994,Kim Jong Il,"We are seeing out this year, still grieving over the death of the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung. The great leader dedicated all his efforts to the freedom and happiness of our people and to the prosperity and development of our country. Making our country, our motherland, ever more prosperous was his intention and his cause. We must remain true to his intention and cause and make our country, our motherland, ever more prosperous. I am going to send our people and the officers and men of the Korean People’s Army New Year greetings to the effect that we should work energetically, with a single heart and with one purpose, to make our country, our motherland, ever more prosperous. Our country is Juche Korea, home to Kim Il Sung’s nation, and our motherland is our socialist country. In this sense, I will use the words “our country” and “our motherland” in my New Year greetings. It is my firm determination to bring further prosperity to our country, our motherland. I will make no concessions in carrying forward Comrade Kim Il Sung’s intention and cause. What is important in making our country, our motherland, ever 451 more prosperous is to ensure that all Party members and other working people nurture an unshakeable faith in socialism. Only then can they strive to defend their socialist motherland and make it prosperous. Nurturing an unshakeable faith in socialism is all the more important after socialism collapsed in the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries and since the imperialists and reactionaries are manoeuvring craftily to crush our country’s socialism. The people of the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries failed to defend socialism and returned to capitalism, simply because they did not nurture a faith in socialism. Only now are they admitting that socialism was better and regretting its loss. Although socialism collapsed in several countries, it still remains alive in the hearts of the people. I wrote the treatise Socialism Is a Science and published it in order to deal a blow at the imperialists and reactionaries who are opposed to socialism, and to instil confidence in the sure victory of socialism in the hearts of the people. The treatise clarifies the scientific accuracy and truthfulness of socialism. People all over the world say that the treatise is my political programme by which Korea will follow the road of socialism without vacillating. Our country is politically stable and all the people are firmly united. International social circles recognize the solidity of our socialism. Ours is socialism that is centred on the masses, where the people are masters of everything and everything serves them. Today, the progressive people of the world, the people of the countries where socialism collapsed in particular, are envious of and look up to our socialism that is centred on the masses. Recently some scholars from a country where socialism had collapsed visited our country; I was told that after looking round Pyongyang, they said they had learned a lot from Korea’s socialism, adding that they could not find anyone who was begging, drunk or dressed in jeans. Party organizations should intensify ideological education among cadres, Party members and other working people in various forms and by various methods so that they cherish a strong faith in socialism 452 and devote themselves to the victory of the socialist cause. In order to make our country, our motherland, ever more prosperous, the Party’s leadership system must be firmly established. Our prosperous and powerful country and motherland would be scarcely conceivable, separated from the system by which the whole Party, all the people and the entire army move as one under the Party’s leadership. In establishing the Party’s leadership system, it is important to establish the revolutionary discipline of accepting the Party’s policies unconditionally and implementing them to the letter. Recently, the Party put forward the policy of enhancing the role of the county so as to bring about an upturn in the people’s standard of living; the chief secretaries of all county Party committees should work with a sense of responsibility by giving play to the spirit of carrying out the Party’s policies without any qualification. We should make stronger demands on officials so that they all accept the Party’s policies without any conditions attached, and carry them out. They should display burning loyalty in implementing the Party’s policies until the last moment of their lives. The greatest shortcoming of our officials is their way of working with an initial blaze of enthusiasm that quickly cools. They should not work in such a manner. One’s burning loyalty to the Party must never cool, right up until the last moment of one’s life. Party organizations should not take over administrative and economic work and act high-handedly on the plea that they have been instructed to establish the Party’s leadership system. As I always say, the Party must exercise political guidance over administrative and economic work. In order to make our country, our motherland, ever more prosperous, we should all unite with a single heart and single purpose. The single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks is an important guarantee for making our country, our motherland, ever more prosperous. It is only when we strengthen the unity of the revolutionary ranks that the driving force of the revolution can be consolidated and the building of socialism stepped up. Our revolutionary ranks are now united with one heart. We must not rest 453 content with this, but continue to strengthen the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks further, as required by the prevailing situation and the revolutionary tasks facing the Party. What is important in strengthening the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks is to ensure that the whole Party, all the people and the entire army uphold the leader with loyalty. Above all, cadres should uphold the Party’s leadership with loyalty. A general by himself is no general. I formulate policies and implement them by relying on people who are faithful to me. As there are faithful men beside me, so I exist; and as I exist, so there are faithful men beside me. In the past, the anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters did not know that Comrade Kim Il Sung would become the general secretary of our Party or the generalissimo, but they were convinced that they could accomplish the Korean revolution only when they held him in high esteem, and they travelled the road of the long-drawn-out revolution without wavering, following him. What is precious is their belief that they could accomplish the Korean revolution only by following him. Cadres should learn from the noble revolutionary spirit of the anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters and, whether in good times or bad, maintain their loyalty to the Party. A day lived loyally in bad times is more important than a hundred loyal days in good times. Those who follow the Party in good times but abandon it in bad times are devoid of a sense of obligation. Revolutionaries must value their revolutionary obligation and remain true to it, to the last. We should ensure that the young generation, too, learn from the noble revolutionary spirit of the anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters and support the Party’s leadership with loyalty. In particular, we should see to it that the young people are faithful to the Party’s leadership and support it to the end. The young people are the successors to our revolution; and when they are faithful to the Party’s leadership and support it to the last, the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered by Comrade Kim Il Sung will be carried forward and completed with success through the generations. This is why I pay 454 such deep attention to the young people and direct such great efforts to the work with them. I ensured that the joint editorial to be published on New Year’s Day was written in the name of the organ of the Youth League, along with those of the Party and the People’s Army. The young people will be pleased about this. The People’s Army is faithful to the Party’s leadership. The officers of the People’s Army place absolute trust in me; they are prepared to fight a life-or-death battle if I order them to do so. I meet the officers of the People’s Army now and then to give them encouragement. I intend to visit a unit of the People’s Army tomorrow, New Year’s Day, to encourage the soldiers. I feel most happy when I am among them. We should ensure that all the officers and men of the People’s Army defend the socialist motherland with their arms, loyally supporting the Party’s leadership. Class education should be strengthened among Party members and other working people. Party organizations and officials are paying inadequate attention to class education. The low level of people’s class consciousness and the poor demonstration by the working people of the revolutionary spirit of Mt Paektu, the revolutionary spirit of fortitude, which the antiJapanese revolutionary fighters cherished, can largely be attributed to their poor class education. The current standard of living of our people cannot be said to be very high, but it is still higher than it was in the past. The young generation, not knowing what hardship is, are enjoying a life in which there is nothing in the world for them to envy. If class education is not conducted effectively, there may appear such tendencies among the rising generation of complaining about their life today, oblivious of the past when their grandfathers and grandmothers were exploited and oppressed and, worse still, of them abandoning the revolution and seeking a comfortable life for themselves, because they are enthralled by revisionist ideas; then it will be impossible to defend socialism, which was built by the blood and sweat of the preceding generations. In recent years socialism collapsed in several countries, 455 mainly because they neglected class education and abandoned the class struggle. After assuming state power, Khrushchev weakened the function of the dictatorship of the state as a weapon of the class struggle. As a result, socialism could not be defended in the Soviet Union. Since socialism collapsed there and the Soviet Union itself was broken up, those who schemed against Soviet power in the past and their descendants have become parvenus, and those who fought in defence of Soviet power and their descendants have become beggars and unemployed. Historical lessons show that for a workingclass party to neglect class education and abandon class principles amounts to digging its own grave. We are now defending socialism and conducting the revolution and construction in direct confrontation with US imperialism. We are waging what could be called a war without gunfire. We should get ready to wage a bloody struggle should the enemy attack us, and we must win the fight against the US imperialists by any means. Only when class education is intensified among Party members and other working people so as to raise their class consciousness can they rise up in the struggle against the US imperialists and safeguard socialism with their lives and make our country, our motherland, ever more prosperous. We should intensify class education among Party members and other working people, especially the rising generation, to ensure that they do not entertain even the slightest illusion about their class enemy. For this, we need a proper methodology. Telling the young generation what the landowners and their agents were like, what it was like to wear hemp clothes and straw sandals, and about other aspects of life in the days of their grandparents’ generation does not amount to adequate class education. Informing them of how hard their parents worked in their youth is also a form of class education. Class education should also be conducted by means of works of art and literature. Whenever the sector of art and literature is instructed to create works that can contribute to class education, the writers attempt to write only about the exploitative nature of 456 landowners and capitalists, and not about how the parents of the rising generation fought to defend the motherland in the period of the Fatherland Liberation War, how they rebuilt the devastated cities, farm villages and factories on the debris by tightening their belts and built socialism in the period of post-war reconstruction, or how they devoted their youth to the motherland and people in the period of the grand construction of socialism. Few of the songs and films created in recent years are about the worthwhile way in which the parents of the rising generation spent their youth. We should see to it that works of art and literature depicting how our people built our socialist motherland in the difficult circumstances in the past under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung and the Party are created in large numbers for educating the young generation. In order to make our country, our motherland, ever more prosperous, we should rapidly develop science and technology. Only by doing this can we make our people’s life more bountiful and cultured, humble the imperialists’ pride in their “technological superiority” and bring about the prosperity of the socialist motherland. In order to develop science and technology as quickly as possible, we should train the next generation of scientists and technicians in a planned way. It seems that such training is not being organized in detail. Comrade Kim Il Sung pointed out that after Dr. Won Hong Gu passed away we had no ornithologist worth mentioning, and that it had been wrong for us not to have assigned young scientists for him to train as able scientists. Experts on Chinese characters have been trained because young scholars were apprenticed to Hong Ki Mun, and they proved their worth in the translation and publication of the scores of volumes of Rijo Sillok (Chronicles of the Ri Dynasty). While training a large number of young scientists, we should maintain an appropriate proportion of them in the ranks of old and middle-aged scientists. Scientists must achieve success in their research in their twenties or thirties and thus establish their reputation. They must become doctors and associate doctors in their 457 twenties and thirties and academicians in their forties and fifties. In order to develop science and technology, we should increase investment in this sector. The sufficient supply of the latest research equipment and experimental apparatuses is essential for conducting successful scientific research work. For the present, the state-of-theart equipment needed for the development of the electronics industry should be imported. We must raise the electronics industry to the world standard at an early date. We should, at the same time as increasing investment in the scientific research sector, strengthen the education of scientists. Party organizations should strengthen their ideological education and organizational life so as to ensure that they all devote their wisdom and energy to scientific research with a high degree of loyalty to the Party, a strong will and the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. We should conduct effective external work so as to create circumstances favourable for our revolution. We should be assertive in the talks with the United States. Recently we took the step of opening our territorial airspace to passenger planes from foreign countries. Having done so, we had to shoot down a US military helicopter that had intruded into our territorial airspace. The United States once again submitted an apology to us. This was a great victory for us. We returned the pilot of the helicopter only after receiving the apology. Afterwards, the pilot said that he had not been confined to a jail or barracks but had been treated well and given good accommodation. We must entertain no illusions about US imperialism. We must not make concessions or retreat in the confrontation with the US imperialists, but set our face against them.",see grieve over death leader sung leader dedicate effort freedom happiness

01.01.1995,Kim Jong Il,"On this morning of New Year’s Day, I, along with the senior commanding officers of the Korean People’s Army, paid tribute to the late President Kim Il Sung. Throughout the past 30 years I had discussed work over the telephone with the President every day. My memories of his daily phone call made my yearning for him stronger, and I felt somewhat lonely. So, on my way to conduct a field inspection of units of the People’s Army I stopped at the Kumsusan Assembly Hall to pay homage to the President. Having done so, I felt a little easier in my mind. Seeing the year 1994 out amid bitter tears and seeing the new year 1995 in, we must strengthen our resolve to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche without fail. To mark the New Year I sent a letter addressed to all the people, which reads; “Let all of us work energetically, single-heartedly and with one purpose to make our country, our motherland, ever more prosperous as befits the soldiers and devoted followers of the great leader.” Here “our country” means Juche Korea liberated by the President and “our motherland” means the people-centred socialist motherland established by him. We should strive for the good of Juche Korea and people-centred socialism. Many units, having received my letter, held meetings and replied with letters of resolve, which I found very praiseworthy. In my New Year letter I wrote that our people are the disciples of the great leader, in the sense that they are all soldiers taught and brought up by him. All of our officials have grown up under his personal care. Our Party has many hard-core elements who are faithful to their leader. Thanks to their active support, there is me, General Kim Jong Il. One cannot become a general on one’s own. I administer state affairs by combining their wisdom and relying on them. All officials should redouble their efforts to make our country, our motherland, more prosperous, working with one mind and purpose with me. True to the message of the song, revolutionaries should share the same purpose with their leader. To become one in mind and purpose means the leader and the people sharing the same spirit. We should work hard for a new victory, all united with one mind and purpose. President Kim Il Sung started his guidance to nation building after Korea’s liberation by giving on-site guidance at the Kangson Steel Plant; he achieved a breakthrough in the challenging postwar reconstruction effort through further on-site guidance at the same place. At the threshold of the new year when we are embarking on a fresh march, I started the work of defending socialism and burnishing it with my inspection of People’s Army units. In order to defend and add lustre to socialism, we should, before anything else, strengthen the People’s Army. Last year we held talks with the United States on the nuclear issue, as a result of which we drew up the DPRK-USA Agreed Framework and elicited a letter of assurance from the US President. At the end of the year we shot down a US reconnaissance helicopter that was illegally intruding into the territorial airspace of our country. These are great victories we achieved in our confrontation with the US imperialists. Our people are thrilled at the fact that the gunners of the People’s Army brought down the US helicopter with a single shot. We have been able to defend our national sovereignty and people’s happiness in the face of the US imperialists, because the People’s Army is strong. In the 1920s a US missionary in Korea wrote, using hydrochloric acid, the word “thief” on the forehead of a Korean boy, simply because he had picked up an apple that had fallen from a tree in his orchard. Now, however, the US imperialists do not dare to provoke our people. We should not rest content with the fact that the People’s Army is strong and we have achieved a great victory in the confrontation with the US imperialists. The nature of a wolf does not change, and nor does the aggressive nature of the US imperialists. We are standing face to face with the US imperialists, the ringleader of the imperialist powers, and have not yet reunified the country, so we should not neglect the strengthening of the People’s Army even for a moment. This year, too, we should continue to focus great efforts on strengthening the People’s Army. The People’s Army should firmly establish within its ranks a military climate that is based on the Party climate. The People’s Army is the army of the Party, the army of the Supreme Commander. The People’s Army should firmly establish such a climate in order to perform its mission and role to the full as the army of the Party, as the army of the Supreme Commander. It is important to improve logistical services for the People’s Army. We should organize this work well so that the People’s Army soldiers do not feel any discomfort, whether on or off duty. We should increase the production of military supplies. Only then can we supply the People’s Army with sufficient modern weapons and ammunition. The officials concerned should exert great efforts to this end, bearing in mind that the slightest neglect may result in our country falling prey to the US imperialists. We should further fortify the internal position, the socialist class position, of our revolution. Doing so will provide an important guarantee for defending and adding lustre to our Korean-style, people-centred socialism established by President Kim Il Sung. With the enemy making a cunning attempt to undermine our system from within by pursuing an “appeasement policy” in order to demolish our people-centred socialism, if we sit idle, doing nothing to fortify the class position of socialism, the consequences may be grave. We should educate our Party members and other working people to advocate socialism strongly and strive staunchly to bring the socialist cause to completion. It is important to develop the national economy and improve the people’s living standards; this should be done by implementing the Party’s revolutionary economic strategy. The key to improving the people’s living standards is to solve the food problem. We should leave no stone unturned in ensuring that farming is successful this year. To this end, we should carry out the specific tasks set out by the President in the letter he sent to the National Conference of Agriculture held in February last year. We should also focus on the production and supply of consumer goods. Soybean paste and sauce are no less important than rice in our people’s diet. Tasty soybean paste and sauce are essential to the production of several side dishes and hence the improvement of the people’s diet. In order to supply the people with tasty soybean paste and sauce we should build modern, large-capacity soybean paste and sauce factories. As heating is also an important issue in the people’s living conditions, we should provide it in a responsible manner. If we are to carry out our tasks in the new year successfully, officials should play their role properly. The state of our people’s ideological and spiritual preparedness is now very good. Since the leader passed away, I have found our people to be really good and strong in their unity. I am optimistic about the future. The point at issue is how our officials play their role. The more arduous and rigorous the revolution is, the more responsibly all officials should carry out their duties, displaying boundless loyalty to the Party and the leader and a noble self-sacrificing spirit.It is important to deal properly with work at the ideological front, the front of art and literature. Music is a powerful weapon for educating people in a revolutionary way and inspiring them in the struggle. I am particularly fond of Song of Comradeship, which well reflects the will of the Party. While giving guidance to the art and literature sector in the 1970s, I said to the officials that we should share the same will; Song of Comradeship was written, based on what I said. President Kim Il Sung instructed that the Korean revolution, which began with comradeship, should win victory through comradeship; his instruction is truly pertinent. The wartime song My Song in the Trench contains the wonderful and vivid line I’ll take my dear parents, dear wife and children into my arms. One should always feel affection for one’s family. Only then can one be patriotic and love one’s socialist motherland. We should direct close attention to implanting socialist patriotism and the Korean-nation-first spirit in the hearts of the people. Our socialist motherland and our nation are Kim Il Sung’s motherland and Kim Il Sung’s nation. Many songs created in the past should be unearthed and sung again. New singers might not know the songs created in the 1960s and 1970s. It would be better to have such songs sung in the form of series, rather than individually. Most of the songs on the TV and radio are by the Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble. I have been guiding the work of this ensemble since the 1980s, and it started proving its worth from the 1990s. The members of the ensemble were trained for about ten years, from when they were teenagers; they are now playing an important role in the development of music in our country. Their music is a source of Korean music. It is the repository of a whole spectrum of songs about all sectors. The ensemble has been re-arranging and disseminating our national folk songs. I consider the Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble equal to the military band of the Supreme Headquarters. I frequently assign this ensemble the task of creating new songs; and whenever a new song is created, I have it disseminated throughout the country. I have put the finishing touches to the songs created by the ensemble. The members of this ensemble should work harder. In our country a great number of good songs reflecting the demands of the times and the people are being created and popularized, under the guidance of the Party. It is natural for a prosperous country to resound with songs. The President once said that the people have come to enjoy a happy life because the country is prosperous. We should bring about an upsurge in the people’s laughter in the new year",morning new along senior command officer army pay tribute late sung throughout past year have discuss over telephone memory

02.03.1995,Kim Jong Il,"I am very glad to be meeting you officials of Chongryon (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan) today in the homeland. Last year our people suffered the greatest national sorrow of losing President Kim Il Sung. The demise of the President was the greatest loss ever suffered by our Party and the state. Since his death our people have more keenly felt how great their leader was and how blessed they were in having him. Our President was a great leader, a great revolutionary, a great man and a benevolent father of the people. During the period of mourning following the death of the President last year Chongryon organized several significant memorial services. The Chongryon officials and other Korean compatriots in Japan shared their great sorrow over the loss of the President with the people in the homeland; they did not lose their confidence and courage, even in the face of the unbearable pain of loss. Braced by their absolute confidence in our Party, they pushed ahead dynamically with the patriotic work of Chongryon. This shows that all the officials of the Central Standing Committee of Chongryon, including those in the information and cultural departments, conducted proper education in loyalty to their leaders among the Korean compatriots in Japan. I am grateful for this. As you must have witnessed, the people in the homeland are in high spirits and the state of affairs here is good. The trust of our people in the Party has grown stronger, the single-hearted unity between the Party and the people has been made rock-solid, and unprecedented leaps and miracles are being wrought on all fronts of socialist construction. In hearty response to the slogan put forward in the joint editorial of the newspapers of the Party, the People’s Army and the Youth League, the people in the homeland are making vigorous efforts to make their country, their motherland, ever more prosperous as befits the soldiers and devoted followers of the great leader. Around the world, people of conscience, progressive peoples and journalists are rendering active support and encouragement to our Juche revolutionary cause. Availing myself of this opportunity, I will refer briefly to some tasks for strengthening Chongryon organizationally and ideologically. It is important above all else in strengthening the ranks of Chongryon organizationally and ideologically to conduct proper ideological education in keeping with the requirements of the developing reality. Chongryon has recently achieved a number of successes by intensifying various forms of ideological education, such as education in the greatness of our Party, among its officials and other compatriots. Chongryon should direct continuous efforts to ideological education of its officials and other compatriots. The main focus of ideological work at present should be the education of the third and fourth generations of the revolution. The education of the third and fourth generations of the revolution is associated with the future of the revolution and is a key issue in both Chongryon and the homeland. There is no problem with the first generation of the revolution. The first generation of the revolution remain unchanged, whatever the circumstances. Their ideology is flawless. But the third and fourth generations are different from the first generation in that they have not experienced trials and hardships. In particular, the Korean compatriots of the third and fourth generations who were born and grew up in Japan have not experienced firsthand the sorrow of a ruined nation and do not fully realize how precious and benevolent their motherland is. Since they are living in a country where the material conditions are a little better than in their homeland, they are apt to gradually forget about their motherland; their love of their homeland and nation may cool, and they may fail to maintain the bloodline of the Korean nation, which was inherited by their parents. With the imperialists and reactionaries making every effort to cause vacillation and ideological degeneration among the rising generation by capitalizing on the change of generation in the revolution in an attempt to prevent the revolution being carried on through the generations, it is imperative to intensify education among the young Koreans in Japan. Bringing them up soundly through intensive education is extremely important in view of the position of Chongryon in carrying out the revolutionary cause of Juche. Chongryon is an organization working not only in defence of the democratic national rights and interests of Koreans in Japan but for national reunification. It should also fight for the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of Juche and for the realization of the cause of global independence, sharing the same destiny as the homeland. To this end, it should nurture sound Korean compatriots of the third and fourth, fifth and sixth generations so that they brilliantly inherit the patriotic cause of Chongryon. Even in its work with businesspeople Chongryon should direct its primary attention to the work with those of the third and fourth generations. Chongryon should conduct the education of its new generation intensively so that the young people of the third and fourth generations emulate the example and loyalty of the old generation, the first generation of the revolution, and brilliantly carry forward and develop all the achievements of their predecessors. Chongryon should educate the third and fourth generations for them to cherish firm faith in socialism. To this end, it is important to bring home to them the essential advantages of the people-centred socialism of our style. Our Juche-oriented style of socialism embodies the aspirations and demands of the masses of the people. There is no social system other than our style of socialism in which people lead independent political, cultural, material lives to their heart’s content. Everyone in our country is leading an independent political life. All the people exercise full rights as genuine masters of the state and society and exalt their socio-political integrity through their activities in Party and working people’s organizations. In a capitalist society, where political activities are extremely reactionary, the working people are not assured of genuine freedom, democracy and human rights, and their independence is trodden on mercilessly. The same is the case in the countries where socialism collapsed and capitalism was revived. All the people in our country are leading independent material and cultural lives also in the spheres of the economy and culture. These three aspects of life, reflecting the demands and aspirations of the masses of the people for independence, should be at the heart of any analysis of the superiority of our socialism. If you talk about the superiority of our socialism in a one-sided and superficial manner, merely saying that socialism in the homeland is good and there is sufficient of everything there, you cannot help the young compatriots of the third and fourth generations to have a correct understanding of it. Education in socialism should be conducted substantially by a correct methodology in such a way as to implant in the younger generation the clear message that, although hardships and shortages are to be expected in the course of building socialism, they can certainly be dealt with, and that they should work energetically to defend and add lustre to our Juche-oriented style of socialism in order to make our people better off. In order to give them a correct understanding of the essential superiority of our socialism, it is necessary to conduct education through comparison by citing negative examples. This enables the people to distinguish good from bad easily and understand the essence of a problem correctly. Materials providing an accurate analysis of capitalism, where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer with each passing day, if used in education, will be effective in helping the new generation to fully understand that our socialist system is best. Chongryon should conduct proper education through comparison among the compatriots so that they can understand the difference between socialism and capitalism and the reason why socialism is called the people’s paradise. My treatise Socialism Is a Science elucidates in detail why socialism is so advantageous. Businesspeople account for a large proportion of our compatriots in Japan, and it seems to me that most of them cannot be said to be leading an affluent life. Almost all of them are selling their labour. A businessperson managing a shop is a small businessperson and should not be considered rich. Taking such examples, Chongryon should educate the third and fourth generations well enough for them to understand the superiority of our style of people-centred socialism, so that they have full confidence in the victory of the cause of socialism, ardently love their socialist motherland and give positive support and encouragement to socialist construction in the homeland. Chongryon should help the third and fourth generations to cherish the soul of Korea, the soul of the nation. To this end, it should instil in them national pride and honour in the fact that my country, my motherland, of Juche is best, and the Korean-nation-first spirit. By my country I mean Korea where the Tangun nation, the Kim Il Sung nation, live; by my motherland I mean the socialist motherland of Juche. Chongryon is working well to implant the soul of Korea, the soul of the nation, in the Korean residents in Japan. Compatriots under Chongryon like to sing Korean folk songs to the accompaniment of national instruments, dance Korean folk dances and play Korean folk games. The girl students at Korean schools prefer to wear the Korean chima (skirt–Tr.) and jogori (jacket–Tr.), they say. This shows that Chongryon has been educating the Korean compatriots well so that they possess national pride and honour in their country and motherland being best. Chongryon should teach the third and fourth generations to live proudly as overseas citizens of Juche Korea, bearing in mind that they are always together with their country and their motherland spiritually, though they are living physically in Japan, where the bourgeois way of life is rampant. Ideological education of Korean compatriots in Japan should be conducted in a form and by a method appropriate to the reality of Chongryon and the circumstances in Japan. As I have already mentioned, ideological education in Chongryon should not necessarily follow the pattern common in the homeland. Of course, no concession is tolerable in the content of ideological education. However, you should not attempt to carry out this undertaking using the same form and method as in the homeland, in disregard of the circumstances. In its content ideological education should thoroughly advocate the homeland and socialism, but its form and method should be diversified and suited to the circumstances and the reality of Chongryon. However good the content of ideological education is, it may not be readily accepted by the compatriots unless its form and method accord with the circumstances and their aspirations and demands in life. Simply arranging study sessions or lecture meetings and force-feeding the content of teaching and study materials from the homeland wholesale, without any methodology, will bring no success in ideological work. Teaching and study materials from the homeland may be used as reference books, but should not be force-fed wholesale to the compatriots. Chongryon should study how to educate compatriots. Its officials should think and plan, and its information workers responsible for winning the hearts of the compatriots in particular, before anyone else, should always think day and night over the forms and methods of ideological education, preparing themselves as people of thought, planning and action. Culture under Chongryon should be developed as the patriotic culture, filled with longing and love for the socialist homeland. However, in its form it should accord with the specific conditions in Chongryon and the circumstances in Japan. I hope that the information workers of Chongryon will conduct the education of officials and compatriots vigorously in keeping with the requirements of the current situation. They should do so by means of all education networks, publications and other art and literary tools, filled with pride and honour in standing at the outpost of ideological work, and thus bring about a fresh change in the ideological work of Chongryon. Chongryon should be developed into a powerful patriotic organization of Juche that is deeply rooted among the masses of compatriots. It should not be a castle in the air without any foothold among the masses, as is the case with a bourgeois organization, bourgeois party. Today I want to ask you earnestly not to develop Chongryon into a bureaucratic, administrative and business-first organization, but into an organization that has struck root deep among the masses of compatriots. If Chongryon officials perform their duties in a bureaucratic and subjective manner, without going among the compatriots, Chongryon will inevitably become an administrative and bureaucratic organization. Our Party, too, is conducting a sweeping campaign to do away with bureaucratism and subjectivism. In the days when Chairman Han Tok Su and other officials were working to found Chongryon, bureaucracy was alien to them. They went among the compatriots, awakening and rallying them through persistent explanation and persuasion. Their work with the compatriots yielded rich rewards. However, from the time when Chongryon officials were allowed to work legally following its founding, there gradually appeared instances of bureaucratism. Chongryon should be an out-and-out living organization that is popular among the masses of compatriots. All the officials of Chongryon from its centre to the prefectural headquarters and chapters should take loving care of the compatriots and be their true friends and faithful servants. They should not make themselves administrative bureaucrats who are domineering over their compatriots; instead, they should strive to become officials who command the love and respect of their compatriots. Chongryon should pay special attention to strengthening the unity of its officials and compatriots. In the difficult situation in which it is currently working, it should guard against the slightest expression detrimental to the unity of its ranks. Chongryon should have its own core and centre. It should firmly establish a work system with Chairman Han Tok Su as the centre of leadership and with First Vice-Chairman Ri Jin Gyu as the centre of administration, and all its officials should conduct patriotic work, united single-heartedly. I am delighted and relieved to hear that Chairman Han Tok Su is in good health. I ask you to convey my regards, upon your return, to Chairman Han Tok Su, First Vice-Chairman Ri Jin Gyu and the other vice-chairpersons and officials of the Central Standing Committee of Chongryon, as well as to the comrades in the information and cultural departments. Whenever I am facing difficulties, I think of my comrades in Chongryon, sharing sweets and bitters with their socialist motherland. Not once did I think that my comrades in Chongryon were also going through difficulties. I want you also to convey my expectations that they would work hard in the future, too, invariably casting in their lot with the homeland, whatever the trials. As I was tied up in my work, I failed to see the performance by the Chongryon art troupe visiting the homeland, but during the forthcoming April Spring Friendship Art Festival I will surely see the performance. I ask you to convey my regards to the artistes of the Chongryon art troupe",glad meet official chongryon general association resident japan today homeland last suffer great sorrow lose sung demise

24.05.1995,Kim Jong Il,"Today, our compatriots in Japan, with the great honour and pride of being overseas citizens of Juche Korea, are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon). They are attracting a lot of attention and receiving the best wishes of those in their homeland. On its 40th anniversary, I extend fervent congratulations and warm compatriotic greetings to Chairman Han Tok Su, other Chongryon officials and all our brothers and sisters in Japan. Chongryon is a dignified organization of our Republic’s overseas citizens, formed and guided by the respected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung. It is a Juche-type organization of our overseas compatriots, which is developing the movement of Koreans in Japan under the banner of the great Juche idea. The movement is a national, patriotic movement of our compatriots in Japan. They were subject to harsh national oppression and maltreatment in the years of Japanese imperialist colonial rule and are now fighting, as overseas citizens of an independent and sovereign state, for their national rights and interests and for their homeland and nation. Before Chongryon was formed, the movement of Koreans in Japan had to suffer many tortuous events because it did not have a correct line, suited to its character and demands. Repression by the Japanese reactionaries and the influence of a Leftist line, which was detrimental to the patriotic national struggle of our compatriots in Japan, laid grave obstacles in their way. They seriously damaged the movement and drove it to the brink of collapse. Analyzing the state of the movement of Koreans in Japan from the Juche viewpoint, the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung proposed changing their policy to one whereby the Koreans, though living in Japan, must fight for their homeland and nation and the revolution in their own country. He thus clearly showed the way to save the movement from crisis and develop it into an independent, patriotic national movement. Patriots and other Koreans in Japan worked hard under the great leader’s guidance to implement his Juche-oriented policy on changing their line. They finally founded the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan on May 25, 1955. The formation of Chongryon was the brilliant fruition of the great leader’s idea and his guidance of our overseas compatriots’ movement. It was a historic event which brought about a radical change in its development and in the lives of Koreans in Japan. The formation of Chongryon enabled the movement to become a solid, patriotic national movement guided by the Juche idea. It encouraged our compatriots in Japan to shape their destiny independently, on the strength of a genuine organization of their own which represents and champions their national rights and interests. The formation of Chongryon, which opened up the era of the Juche-oriented overseas compatriots’ movement, was a brilliant example of blazing a new path for the overseas compatriots’ movement in the age of independence. In the 40 years since its formation, Chongryon has travelled a victorious path, going through many difficulties and trials. The 40 years of its advance represents a proud history, during which it has exalted its dignity and honour as an organization of overseas compatriots of Juche Korea under the guidance of the great leader. The 40 years of its advance also represents a glorious history, during which it has championed the national rights and interests of our compatriots in Japan and contributed to their homeland’s prosperity and development and to national reunification. Thwarting the manoeuvres against it of reactionaries at home and abroad at every stage, Chongryon has established well-ordered organizational and work systems from the centre down to the chapters by maintaining its lawful status. It has achieved a unity of idea and purpose, and solidarity in its ranks. It has formed unified mass organizations embracing different sections of compatriots to suit its mass character. It has stepped up its work among the different sections and thus rallied the broad masses of compatriots closely behind it. It has now become a strong mass organization with solid organizational and ideological ranks and with deep roots among the masses of compatriots. It has grown into an authoritative, powerful organization of our overseas compatriots, which is reliably leading the movement of Koreans in Japan along the road of Juche, even in complex and difficult conditions. Chongryon has achieved great success in the struggle to safeguard the national rights of our compatriots in Japan, by moving its organization and rousing broad sections of compatriots. It has made precious achievements by working hard in the patriotic cause of helping the socialist homeland’s prosperity and development and national reunification. Chongryon has opposed the Japanese reactionaries’ unjust national discrimination policy and defended our compatriots’ democratic national rights and dignity. It has established a well-ordered educational system, ranging from primary school to university. It has developed national education and brought up the younger generation of our compatriots into stalwart patriots. Our compatriots in Japan, who suffered all sorts of persecution, lack of rights and poverty in a foreign land in the past, now exercise their rights as overseas citizens of an independent and sovereign state. They are developing national education and culture and lead decent lives with national pride and self-confidence. They owe all this to Chongryon, which is waging an active struggle for their rights and interests, by assuming the responsibility for their destiny. In the trying situation in which imperialist and reactionary manoeuvres against socialism and our Republic are never ending, Chongryon and our compatriots in Japan have always fought staunchly in defence of their socialist motherland in the same ranks as people at home, without the slightest vacillation. They have exerted all their sincere efforts to promote its prosperity and development. Their motherland will always remember their noble, patriotic devotion to their socialist homeland. Chongryon has supported the policy of the Government of our Republic for national reunification and worked hard to realize it. It has stepped up the work of achieving the national unity of our compatriots and given strong support and encouragement to the patriotic struggle of south Korean students and other people. Chongryon has strengthened friendship with the Japanese and many other peoples throughout the world. It has expanded and developed its ties with international organizations, and thus created a favourable international climate for the movement of Koreans in Japan. It has made a great contribution to exalting our Republic’s authority with regard to the outside world. There is no overseas nationals’ organization in the world like our Chongryon, which, even in difficult conditions in a foreign land, has built up a well-regulated system of organizations from top to bottom, its own educational institutions, businesses, cultural institutions and the press, which has solidly rallied the broad masses of compatriots and which is vigorously conducting a just, patriotic national movement. It is our Republic’s pride and the nation’s honour that we have a powerful organization of overseas compatriots like Chongryon, which is unfailingly loyal to its leader, nation and homeland and which is confidently leading the movement of Koreans in Japan to victory. I speak highly of Chongryon which, despite all the past difficulties and trials, has successfully fulfilled its honourable mission and duties and thus rendered distinguished service to the country and nation. Today, the movement of Koreans in Japan has entered a new stage of development. The movement of Koreans in Japan and of our brothers in other lands is a patriotic, national movement. As such, it champions their rights and interests and at the same time, it serves the Juche revolutionary cause. Our Party and people are faced with the historic task of carrying forward and accomplishing the Juche revolutionary cause pioneered and guided by the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung. The people in the homeland are now on a historic march towards the brilliant fulfilment of the Juche revolutionary cause, closely united behind our Party, single-heartedly and with one purpose. They loyally support the Party leadership, true to the great leader’s behests. Officials of Chongryon and our compatriots in Japan must make a new advance in their movement, in step with the dynamic march of those in their homeland. Chongryon officials and our compatriots in Japan must hold the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung in high esteem for ever. They must do all Chongryon’s work as he intended and hoped. Comrade Kim Il Sung, the first great leader our people welcomed and highly acclaimed in their 5 000-year history, was a gifted thinker and theoretician, a preeminent statesman, an invincible iron-willed brilliant general, the founder of socialist Korea and our nation’s benevolent father. The respected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung organized and guided Chongryon. He was the benefactor who revived our compatriots in Japan. He formed an original idea and theory of the overseas compatriots’ movement a long time ago. He organized Chongryon by brilliantly applying these to the movement of Koreans in Japan, and clearly indicated the road Chongryon should follow at each stage of its development. The respected leader raised our compatriots in Japan, who were living in tears of blood with the grief of stateless people in a foreign land, to the eminence of legitimate overseas citizens of the country of Juche. He guided them along the road of a worthwhile patriotic struggle. With his greater concern and warmer love for the compatriots living abroad than for the people at home, he held the compatriots in Japan in his tender embrace. He guided their destiny and gave them all his consideration. Chongryon officials and our compatriots in Japan must always remember the fatherly leader’s lifelong efforts to strengthen and develop Chongryon and the movement of Koreans in Japan and the boundlessly warm benevolence he showed them. They must always hold him in the most sincere and highest esteem. Cherishing their constant loyalty to him, they must arm themselves more solidly with his revolutionary ideology. They must glorify his immortal achievements in leading the movement, and thus always strengthen and develop Chongryon as an overseas compatriots’ organization of Comrade Kim Il Sung. The Juche idea, the great leader’s revolutionary idea, is the guiding idea of Chongryon and the guiding banner of the movement of Koreans in Japan. The Juche idea, the man-centred outlook on the world, is the idea of regarding the people as our god. It regards the masses of the people as the most precious beings and demands that everything be made to serve them. It is an idea of patriotism which instils genuine love for their country into people. It lights the road of independent national development and prosperity. Only when it is guided by the Juche idea is it possible to maintain the independence and the patriotic character of the overseas compatriots’ movement and to victoriously develop it. Chongryon must also advance under the unfurled banner of the Juche idea in the future. It must implement this idea to the letter in the movement of Koreans in Japan, so as to demonstrate the justice of our overseas compatriots’ Juche-oriented movement and fully display its strength. The question of overseas compatriots is a link in the whole chain of the national question, the core of which is the matter of national independence. A nation’s independence is its lifeblood. Without independence, a nation’s existence and development are inconceivable. Only when they preserve the spirit of national independence can our overseas compatriots shape their destiny independently, keep the national dignity and live honourably wherever they are. It is the natural desire and legitimate right of members of an independent nation, of overseas compatriots of an independent and sovereign state, to safeguard their nation’s independence, and to love and champion their homeland and nation. Nobody should be allowed to infringe upon their national desires and rights. Where these desires and rights are infringed and trampled on, the overseas compatriots’ struggle inevitably intensifies. The movement of Koreans in Japan is a noble patriotic movement for the nation, a movement whose basic mission is to fight for their national rights, the prosperity and development of their socialist homeland and national reunification. It is an overseas compatriots’ movement which is being conducted in very complex and difficult conditions because of the nature of its origin and the environment in which it fights. Chongryon and our compatriots in Japan must step up the patriotic national struggle in keeping with their movement’s basic mission and actual conditions. They must advance the movement onto a new, higher stage. Defending our compatriots’ democratic national rights and interests is the central task to which Chongryon must invariably adhere in its patriotic activities. Thanks to the stubborn struggle of Chongryon and Korean compatriots in Japan, great success has been achieved in defending their democratic national rights. However, many of their inalienable national rights are still being infringed. This is the aftermath of the Japanese imperialist colonial rule which imposed untold hardship and suffering on our nation in the past; it is also the product of the Japanese authorities’ hostile policy towards our Republic and Chongryon. The infringement of the national rights of Korean citizens in Japan is a violation of our Republic’s sovereignty. This suppression of the right to independence of another nation and the citizens of another country and this violation of the recognized norms of international law are intolerable. Such practices must be stopped without delay. Chongryon must fight more resolutely to ensure that our compatriots in Japan defend the citizenship of our Republic and completely exercise all democratic national rights such as their human rights, the rights to existence and to enterprise, as well as legitimate rights recognized by international law. It must fight strongly against all institutional and administrative discrimination and outrages, aimed at restricting and infringing on the democratic national rights of Korean compatriots in Japan and at persecuting and repressing them. Chongryon’s national education is extremely important for defending the national traits of our overseas compatriots and for bringing up the younger generation into reliable successors of the movement of Koreans in Japan. The task of Chongryon’s national education is to train our compatriots’ children into well-qualified national cadres with a wide range of knowledge, noble moral character and strong physique, and into genuine patriots. Chongryon must establish Juche in national education. It must continually improve the quality, content and methods of this education, in keeping with the local situation. Chongryon must pay great attention to increasing the sense of national independence among our compatriots and preserving their national characteristics. The Korean nation is a resourceful and highly patriotic nation: Koreans have been living in harmony on the same land since olden times, creating a long history and culture, and using the same language as people of the same descent. Wherever they live, our compatriots must preserve their national traits without losing their national spirit. They must be proud of and self-confident in being members of the Korean nation. Chongryon must develop an energetic movement among Korean compatriots in Japan for learning our mother tongue. It must develop our national culture, preserve the fine manners and customs that are peculiar to our nation and strengthen harmony and unity among our compatriots. In this way, the community of our compatriots will always overflow with sound feelings of national culture, and an atmosphere of brotherly love will prevail among them all, an atmosphere of trusting and caring for one another and helping and leading one another forward. Fighting in defence of their socialist homeland and for its prosperity and development is the noble national duty of Chongryon and Korean compatriots in Japan. The destiny of our overseas compatriots is inseparably linked with that of their motherland. The prestige of their motherland is that of the overseas Korean compatriots’ organization. The honour and dignity of their motherland are those of our overseas compatriots. It is only when their motherland is prosperous that overseas Korean compatriots can maintain their national dignity and proudly exercise their national rights. In their own lives, our overseas compatriots feel more keenly than anyone else how dear their motherland is. Our people’s genuine motherland is the people-centred socialist homeland which was established and guided by the great leader. The Juche-oriented socialist homeland, which demonstrates its strong independence, self-sufficiency and self-reliant defence, provides people with flourishing independent lives, and continues to prosper on the strength of the single-hearted unity of the whole of society. It forms a genuine motherly embrace by defending our overseas compatriots and taking care of them. The very existence of this homeland exalts the dignity and honour of our overseas compatriots, and guarantees their national rights and interests. For our overseas compatriots, defending their socialist motherland and contributing to its prosperity and development means carrying out their patriotic duty. Overseas Korean compatriots, though living abroad, must always remember their socialist motherland. They should work hard to make their country and motherland still more prosperous. Those who truly love their motherland and strive for its prosperity and development are genuine patriots. If one lives only for one’s own comfort with no regard for one’s motherland and nation, such a life can never be worthy or happy. One must place the interests of one’s motherland and nation above one’s own interests. One must find life’s worth and happiness in loving and working for one’s motherland and nation. All our overseas compatriots must ardently love their socialist motherland and make a particular contribution to its prosperity and development, those with strength contributing their strength, those with money contributing their money and intellectuals contributing their knowledge. Chongryon must encourage Korean merchants and entrepreneurs and other compatriots in Japan to step up joint venture, co-production and exchange with their homeland in the economy, culture, science and technology and other fields, to help build socialism in their homeland and promote their own interests. Imperialists and reactionaries are now continually plotting to stifle our Republic, the bulwark of socialism, and to destroy our people-centred socialist system. Chongryon and our compatriots in Japan must fight resolutely to smash the enemy’s reactionary ideological offensive and all other machinations against our Republic, and to defend their socialist motherland. Our compatriots in Japan are linked with their homeland through Chongryon. They feel their homeland’s warmth in its activities. Chongryon is the motherly embrace of our compatriots and represents their motherland in Japan. Our compatriots in Japan must set great store by Chongryon. They must firmly defend it, entrust it with their destiny, and implement the patriotic tasks it sets them in good faith. The reunification of our country is the cherished desire of the whole nation and the nation’s supreme task. The division of the country and nation obstructs Korea’s uniform development. It causes misfortune and suffering to all our compatriots–in the north, south and abroad. Our country must be reunified as soon as possible. The whole nation wants reunification and is striving for it. Chongryon and our compatriots in Japan occupy an important place in the struggle for national reunification, and their task is very heavy. Chongryon must step up the reunification movement in keeping with the present situation and its tasks. The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung proposed the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity; the idea of reunifying the country by forming a federation based on one nation, one state, two systems and two governments; and the ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country. These are absolutely correct and reasonable principles and methods of national reunification, in that they fully conform with our nation’s fundamental interests and fully reflect the prevailing situation in our country and the demand of people from all social strata. Chongryon must organize and mobilize broad sections of our compatriots in the struggle to support and implement the principles and ideas of national reunification proposed by the great leader. Great national unity is the basic condition and the decisive factor for the country’s reunification. All Koreans in the north, south and abroad, must firmly unite under the banner of national reunification, by transcending differences of political views, religious beliefs, social systems and residence. Raising the slogan of national unity high, Chongryon must band together various strata of our compatriots in Japan in the ranks for national reunification. It must strengthen the united front with our compatriots affiliated with “Mindan” (Federation of “ROK” Residents in Japan), and thus expand and develop the national reunification movement into a powerful patriotic movement of the 700000 Korean compatriots in Japan. Chongryon must strengthen unity with the south Korean people in the struggle for national reunification. It must actively support and encourage the just struggle of south Korean students and other people for independence, democracy and reunification. Chongryon must strengthen national ties with our compatriots in various countries. It must work hard to see that all our overseas compatriots commit themselves to the sacred cause of national reunification, along with the people in their homeland. Divisive forces at home and abroad are trying to hold back our nation’s aspiration for reunification. They are trying to keep our country divided for ever and further aggravate tension on the Korean peninsula. Chongryon must fight more dauntlessly to oppose, hold back and frustrate all the manoeuvres of the United States and the south Korean rulers to obstruct national unity and the country’s reunification and strain the situation on the Korean peninsula. Many difficulties and obstacles still lie in the way of national reunification, but they can never stop our nation’s growing aspiration for reunification. No force can ever keep our Korean nation divided for ever, the descendants of Tangun, who have lived as a homogeneous nation for their 5 000-year history. It is a vital demand of the whole nation and an inevitable historical trend for us to live as one nation in a reunified country. Our country will be reunified without fail due to the united efforts of the whole nation, in accordance with the nation’s unanimous aspirations and demand. Chongryon must conduct intensive external information work and activities, true to the ideals of independence, peace and friendship that our Republic maintains, in order to strengthen international solidarity with the just cause of our people and the movement of Koreans in Japan. It must strive to cement friendship with the Japanese people and promote its relations with people from Japanese political, social, academic and press circles and in all other fields. It must strive to unite with the world’s people who aspire after independence, and develop its relations with international organizations. To develop the movement of Koreans in Japan, Chongryon must consolidate itself organizationally and ideologically and enhance its role. One generation of the Koreans in their movement in Japan is being replaced by another. The circumstances in which Chongryon is working have changed greatly, and reactionary manoeuvres to disintegrate it are rampant. It is therefore imperative to consolidate Chongryon organizationally and ideologically. The future of the movement of Koreans in Japan depends on how Chongryon strengthens itself in the current situation. A sure guarantee for developing the movement lies precisely in consolidating Chongryon into a powerful organization of overseas compatriots. An important task for Chongryon when consolidating its organization and ideology is to build up a solid hard core, strengthen the unity and cohesion of its ranks, rally broad sections of compatriots around it and steadily raise the level of ideological consciousness of its officials and compatriots. Chongryon must consolidate the ranks of its cadres and give them a proper education regularly. Chongryon’s cadres are its hard core. They constitute the leadership of the movement of Koreans in Japan. Strengthening the ranks of cadres and enhancing their role is the key to consolidating Chongryon and developing the patriotic, national movement in depth to suit the changed conditions. The ranks of Chongryon’s cadres are now composed of faithful workers who devote everything to patriotic work for their motherland and nation. Chongryon has been able to advance unswervingly along the patriotic road even in a complicated situation, mainly because it has built up solid ranks of cadres and because all the cadres have worked devotedly. Chongryon’s cadres must be unfailingly loyal to the motherland and nation. They must win their compatriots’ trust, acquire organizational skills and enterprise, work skilfully and perfect how they work. Chongryon must select and appoint cadres properly, help veteran cadres to continue to work well, and boldly promote young people as cadres. It should steadily improve cadres’ political and practical qualifications and set up a proper system for training reserves of cadre so as to train them in a far-sighted way. It should always educate and temper cadres so that they do not grow ideologically senile but work with intense loyalty and ardent love for the motherland and nation in the face of any adversity. Chongryon must consolidate the unity and cohesion of its ranks, based on the Juche idea. Unity is vital to all mass organizations, and particularly to an organization of overseas compatriots. If an organization of overseas compatriots fails to ensure the unity and cohesion of its ranks, it can neither lead the movement of overseas compatriots nor maintain its own existence. Chongryon must first of all make the unity of its officials rock-solid. On this basis, it must ensure the perfect unity and cohesion of its whole ranks. It must see that the whole of its organization, from top to bottom, works as an organized force which is solidly united in ideology and purpose and with a sense of moral obligation and which works together. Chongryon must work efficiently with compatriots from all walks of life to consolidate its mass foundations. Chongryon can be indestructible only when it has deep roots among the broad masses and enjoys their active support and trust. Its officials must intimately mix with compatriots from various strata. They must conduct forceful mass political work and help and lead compatriots kindly with compatriotic feelings. They must thus rally the broad masses of compatriots solidly behind Chongryon. In its work among compatriots from various strata, Chongryon must direct its main efforts to work with merchants and entrepreneurs. Korean merchants and entrepreneurs in Japan form the basic section of the masses of Chongryon and the main force in the movement of Koreans in Japan. In the past, they suffered all kinds of national humiliation and maltreatment under the oppression of Japanese imperialism. They still do business under difficult conditions due to the national discrimination policy of the Japanese authorities. They are progressive and patriotic merchants and entrepreneurs who, because of their own experience in life, value their motherland and nation and offer their conscience and devotion to the patriotic cause of their motherland and nation. They account for an overwhelming majority of compatriots in Japan and constitute the basic motive force of the movement of Koreans in Japan. Chongryon must establish a well-regulated system of work with them. It must work efficiently with them, especially with young merchants and entrepreneurs. Chongryon must develop the movement of Koreans in Japan by trusting in and relying on merchants and entrepreneurs. It must lead them all to devote themselves to patriotic work with ardent patriotism the consciousness of being masters. Along with intensifying ideological education among them, it must protect their interests, help them in business in every possible way, encourage their patriotic activities and highly appreciate them. Chongryon must pay great attention to work with the younger generation of compatriots. They are successors to the movement of Koreans in Japan and the masters of the future. How the lifeline of the movement is succeeded depends on how the younger generation is brought up. The younger generation, with no first-hand experience of the life of a ruined nation, is now emerging as the main patriotic force. In this situation, the movement can be firmly succeeded only when Chongryon works with them efficiently. Chongryon must intensify its work of teaching them to be ardent patriots so that they acquire a true outlook on life, defend and glorify the gains that the patriotic first generation achieved in the past through an arduous struggle, and so that they take the lead in implementing Chongryon’s patriotic tasks. To rally the broad masses of compatriots closely around it, Chongryon must consolidate its branches and chapters and enhance their role. The chapter, the grass-roots organization of Chongryon, is the unit of compatriots’ life, as well as the unit which implements patriotic tasks, while the branch is the lowest unit of leadership which gives direct guidance to chapters. It is only when branches and chapters are strengthened that Chongryon can be a powerful organization of compatriots which is deeply rooted among them. It is only then that it can successfully perform its patriotic tasks. Chongryon must consolidate its overall organizational and work systems with the main stress on strengthening branches. It must give substantial assistance to chapters to make them all powerful, vivacious, living organizations. When rallying compatriots from different sections around Chongryon, it is important to enhance the role of each affiliate of Chongryon. Its affiliated organizations, such as the Federation of Korean Men of Commerce, the Korean Youth League, and the Women’s Union, are organizations which embrace different strata of the masses and give them ideological education. Chongryon must help and lead these organizations to work among the masses independently and skilfully, to suit their characteristics. The strength of an overseas compatriots’ organization and movement depends on how these compatriots are prepared ideologically. Given the tenacious reactionary manoeuvres now under way to ideologically undermine Chongryon and the movement of Koreans in Japan, Chongryon must intensify ideological education among its officials and compatriots more than ever before. The basic task of Chongryon’s ideological work is to firmly equip all its officials and all compatriots with the Juche outlook on the world and imbue them with genuine patriotism. In keeping with its ideological tasks, Chongryon must teach its officials and compatriots the principles of the Juche idea and socialist patriotism. It must imbue them with the Korean-nation-first spirit and conduct various other forms of education in depth and breadth, so that they all have a strong spirit of national independence and patriotism, and the unshakeable conviction that their cause is just, and so that they remain unfailingly loyal to their leader, nation and motherland. Chongryon must establish a proper system for ideological work and must steadily improve how they carry out this work. It must operate its own network of education, public lectures and information efficiently to suit the actual situation. It must make effective use of the mass media, including Joson Sinbo, and conduct literary, art and sports activities on a mass basis. It must break the outmoded formalistic and stereotyped approach to ideological education without hesitation. It must continually explore forms and methods of ideological education suited to the characteristics of compatriots of various strata and their circumstances, so as to conduct this work in a fresh and realistic way. It is very important for Chongryon officials working abroad to improve how they work. It is only when they have a correct way of working that Chongryon can fuse with the masses of compatriots, promote their patriotic enthusiasm, strengthen national unity, and succeed in all its work. In improving how they work, it is essential for Chongryon officials to thoroughly apply the great leader’s work method to Chongryon’s work. The great leader’s work method is the Juche-oriented method of trusting and loving the masses and implementing the tasks in hand by relying on their efforts and wisdom. Chongryon officials must zealously learn the great leader’s work method. They must perform their duties by firmly relying on the masses of compatriots with trust in and love for them. They must approach them with warmth and sincerity. Chongryon officials must perform their patriotic tasks by always enlisting compatriots’ enthusiasm and creativeness through powerful political work which touches their hearts. They must go among the masses at all times to listen to them and must deal with all problems according to the masses’ opinions and desires. Chongryon officials must become the masses’ close friends and faithful servants who share life and death, good and bad, with them and serve them with devotion. Chongryon officials must not be idle, indolent or stagnant or mark time. They must work energetically, full of stamina and enthusiasm. They must do all work creatively to suit the concrete conditions and the characteristics of those they deal with, unrestrained by past experience or by formulae. The movement of Koreans in Japan is the most powerful of our overseas compatriots’ movements. It is a sacred patriotic movement. It may encounter difficulties and trials, but it will always advance to victory as long as there is the great Juche idea, the great socialist motherland and the mighty Chongryon. I firmly believe that all Chongryon officials and all our compatriots in Japan will work more vigorously under the unfurled banner of the Juche idea, solidly united behind Chongryon’s Central Standing Committee, and that they will achieve new victories in the movement of Koreans in Japan",today compatriot japan honour pride be overseas citizen juche korea celebrate anniversary general association

25.12.1995,Kim Jong Il,"Seventy years has elapsed since the dawn of the Korean revolution, which has advanced under the banner of the Juche idea. In this noble revolution several generations have shed their precious sweat and blood for people’s freedom, national independence and sovereignty and for the victory of socialism. A large number of revolutionaries have performed distinguished services and made brilliant achievements. Our people respect the revolutionaries of the previous generations as their revolutionary seniors, set great store by their spirit and achievements in the struggle, and are carrying faithfully forward and developing the revolutionary cause pioneered by them. This is a noble morality developed by our people from generation to generation, as well as a basic factor that ensures the steady, triumphant development of our revolution even in the most complex situations. The history of the world socialist movement provides the serious lesson that a revolution advances victoriously when revolutionary forefathers are respected and their accomplishments are preserved and developed, and that a revolution is abandoned and frustrated when revolutionary predecessors are betrayed and their accomplishments are   101  negated. In several countries that had built socialism in the past, opportunists occupying the leadership of the parties and states defamed their revolutionary predecessors and obliterated their achievements. In consequence of their traitorous acts, the reputation of communists has been damaged, the image of socialism clouded, and the socialist system itself has ended in collapse. Establishing a correct viewpoint and attitude towards revolutionary seniors is most important for the development of the socialist movement. Only when the red flag of the revolution raised by the revolutionary forerunners is carried forward down through generations can the masses’ cause of independence, the socialist cause, emerge victorious.  1  To respect its pioneers is the demand of the revolution and the noble moral obligation of revolutionaries. Socialism advances to consummation as the successors carry on and develop down through generations what their predecessors achieved for the revolution. Their attitude towards their revolutionary forefathers means their attitude towards the revolution. It is an important matter relating to the destiny of the revolution. Holding revolutionary seniors in esteem means putting forward in every way the revolutionaries who devoted everything to the struggle, championing and preserving their revolutionary ideas and achievements and carrying forward and developing these ideas and achievements. The predecessors’ noble revolutionary ideas and the results of their arduous struggle constitute the gains of the revolution and precious wealth for carrying out the revolution. Only when all succeeding generations champion, preserve and develop their predecessors’ ideas and accomplishments can the revolutionary cause   102  continue to advance to brilliant consummation. Taking a nihilistic approach to their predecessors’ struggle and achievements, or denying them, amounts to retreating from the road of revolution and betraying it. Vilifying revolutionary seniors and defaming their ideas and accomplishments means disgracing the revolution and grovelling at the foot of the enemy of the revolution. The working-class party must, with unbroken consistency, unfailing loyalty to the revolution and unshakeable confidence in this cause, carry forward and develop the socialism pioneered and advanced by the revolutionary predecessors. It must pay close attention to giving prominence to the revolutionary pioneers and to educating the people in the ideas and through the accomplishments of these pioneers. The attitude towards revolutionary forefathers reflects the attitude of revolutionaries towards the revolution, as well as their morality. Morality is a basic criterion for defining the qualities of a revolutionary. A revolutionary must hold not only revolutionary ideals as his belief, but also be equipped with genuine human qualities supported by noble moral principles. Conscience and the sense of obligation are laudable virtues unique to the human race; these are the source of the spiritual force that encourages people to conscientious and noble deeds. Even a person with advanced ideas cannot acquire noble human qualities, nor can he be a true revolutionary, unless he has a strong conscience and the sense of moral obligation. Even in the old society, conscientious people valued morality, by which they evaluated personality and regarded immoral behaviour as unworthy of human beings. In an exploitative society, however, genuine morality cannot thrive or become dominant. Individualism, which is the basis of the exploitative society, cannot be compatible with true morality, and no relations of moral obligation can exist between the exploiting and exploited classes. Moral hypocrisy is the true nature of the exploiting class, and moral corruption is an inevitable product of the bourgeois society. The most ennobling human qualities belong to the communists, who   103  love their fellow people and fight for the masses’ cause of independence. Love for and trust in people are the basis of genuine human relations, the basis of human morality. Promoting the benefit of others rather than of oneself and working with devotion for one’s society and collective are an expression of a person’s noble morality. Because they treasure and love people and place social and collective interests above those of an individual, communists struggle with devotion for the good of their fellow people, their society and collective, not for selfish interests or personal fame. Communist revolutionaries love their comrades and fellow people with noble feelings of love for humanity, and devotedly struggle solely for the people, for their independence, with revolutionary conscience and a lofty sense of moral obligation. A man who shuts his eyes to the people’s interests, who is devoid of love for them and lacks conscience, loyalty and sympathy, cannot be a communist or a revolutionary. Regarding revolutionary pioneers with respect is an inviolable revolutionary obligation. In spite of the difference in seniority in the relationship between seniors and juniors in the revolution, their relations are the comradeship of revolutionaries who fight in the same cause. The relationship between parents and children is kinship resulting mainly from actual physical birth, whereas the relationship among revolutionaries is the comradeship of fighters who share the same ideas, hardships and successes on the road of revolution and exalt their socio-political integrity, which is more precious to them than their physical lives. The kinship among revolutionaries represents a truly communist human relationship based on comradely love and revolutionary obligation. Communist revolutionaries’ outlook on morality and their moral qualities are characterized by their regarding it as a noble duty and honour to love their comrades most ardently and fulfil their revolutionary obligation to them. That is why revolutionaries consider it most shameful and treacherous to betray their comrades or to abandon conscience and loyalty in their mutual relationship. For the heirs to the revolution to respect their revolutionary   104  predecessors–the forerunners who dedicated their lives to the revolution and left a great heritage behind them–can be said to be a noble expression of revolutionary morality. Our revolutionary forerunners gave their lives unhesitatingly in the fight and made precious achievements for the country, the people and the happiness of the coming generations, not for the sake of personal interest or honour; our revolutionary forefathers shouted, “Love the future!” in do-or-die battles, or at the last moment of their lives on the gallows, precisely because they loved the coming generations. By their heroic struggle, the revolutionary forerunners paved the road of revolution, brought about enormous gains for the revolution, and ensured the flowering of an independent and creative new life for people. To respect their revolutionary predecessors, who fought devotedly for those who came after, is the next generations’ natural revolutionary obligation, their noble moral duty. The highest representative of revolutionary elders is the leader, and loyalty to the leader is the highest expression of the sense of revolutionary obligation. The leader of the working class is the guiding intellect and leader of the revolution. The masses of the people make history, but they can hold the position of true masters of their destiny as independent makers of history and fulfil their role as such only when they receive the guidance of a preeminent leader. The leader puts forward scientific revolutionary ideas, strategy and tactics, inspires the masses with revolutionary consciousness and organizes them, guides the revolutionary struggle to victory, provides people with noble socio-political integrity and teaches them to lead honourable lives on the road of revolution. Under his leadership tens of thousands of revolutionaries grow up, and people come to struggle for the revolution. Under his leadership the socialist cause is pioneered and advanced victoriously. Thanks to his noble ideas and outstanding leadership, great revolutionary achievements are made, and the honour and dignity of the revolutionary generations are exalted.   105  Carrying forward the masses’ cause of independence, the cause of socialism, is none other than the continuation of the cause of the leader. Inheriting the ideas and achievements of the revolutionary predecessors means inheriting the leader’s revolutionary ideas and the achievements made under his leadership. Respect for revolutionary predecessors finds typical expression in loyalty to the leader. Being unfailingly loyal to the great leader through all generations is the duty of revolutionaries and the highest expression of the sense of revolutionary obligation. Revolutionaries must resolutely defend the ideas and exploits of the leader and loyally carry forward his revolutionary cause. Historically, in opposing socialism, imperialists and renegades from the revolution have directed their attacks on the leaders of the working class and the revolutionaries of the preceding generations. This is because socialism was pioneered and has triumphed thanks to the guidance of the leader and the self-sacrificing struggle of the revolutionaries of the preceding generations, and because the dignity of socialism is associated with their honour. Modern revisionists and socialist renegades have caused socialism to degenerate and collapse by disgracing the leader and their revolutionary elders and by obliterating their exploits. The process of the degeneration and collapse of socialism began with the emergence of modern revisionism, which vilified the leader and revolutionary pioneers and distorted and debased the revolutionary ideas of the working class. Because of modern revisionists, socialism began to go off the track and crumble from within. Its collapse was due to the policy of “reform” and “restructuring,” pursued by socialist renegades who denied and obliterated every historical achievement of socialism. Opportunists and socialist renegades slandered the leaders of the working class and debased the sacred revolutionary struggle and great revolutionary achievements of their revolutionary predecessors. They destroyed socialism and revived capitalism. This is a most despicable counterrevolutionary crime that betrayed the revolution under the   106  pressure of imperialism, an immoral perfidy that discarded loyalty to the revolution and trampled underfoot elementary human morals. Traitors to the revolution left no stone unturned in slandering and defaming their revolutionary predecessors. Thus they created ideological vacillation and confusion among the people and gave the imperialists and reactionaries the chance to slander the communists and socialism even more viciously. The traitors gained the leading positions of the party and state through an intrigue and tarnished the honour of their revolutionary forerunners in an attempt to enhance their popularity and win support from the people. However, the top hierarchy of the party and state does not necessarily mean the leader, or enjoy the support and respect of the people. People’s confidence cannot be earned by means of power or fraud. If one wants to become a leader and enjoy people’s confidence and support, one must have the personality and qualifications that befit a leader and fulfil the responsibility and role as such. A leader must, above all, be the people’s servant who loves and devotes himself to them. Love for the people and respect for revolutionary predecessors are inseparable. A person who loves the people and is loyal to them is bound to highly respect his revolutionary forerunners who struggled self-sacrificingly for the people. However, one who despises the people and lords it over them does not hesitate to disgrace his revolutionary elders in the most despicable way. The renegades from socialism attempted to vilify the revolutionary leaders and predecessors in a crafty way in order to enhance their own prestige. However, they have revealed their true colours as traitors, as well as their inhuman qualities. Those who have deceived their people and betrayed the revolution will inevitably be forsaken by the people. True revolutionaries who fight for the people and for the victory of socialism must not forget their revolutionary forefathers; instead, they must defend and develop their achievements. This is the way to keep their revolutionary honour and dignity and lead the revolution to victory.   107  2  Being loyal to morality in relation to our revolutionary pioneers is our revolutionary tradition and the noble moral trait of our society. Our revolution, which paved an original way for accomplishing the masses’ cause of independence under the banner of the Juche idea, opened up a new path in the building of communist morality. It set an example of noble and beautiful morality at its early stages and went on to develop it. In our country the tradition of communist morality was created in the flames of the anti-Japanese revolution. It has been carried forward and splendidly put into effect through our struggle to build a new society. Today, under our socialist system which is centred on the masses of the people, communist morality is displayed at a high degree. In our society the leader and his fighters, the Party and the people, are united in one mind, and our people love and help each other like kinsmen, forming a large, harmonious family. This shows the brilliant victory of the Juche idea in the spiritual and moral spheres and demonstrates the superiority of our style of socialism. The communist morality of our people finds its highest expression in their unqualified respect for and absolute allegiance to the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung. The respected Comrade Kim Il Sung was a great leader, acclaimed and venerated as such by our people for the first time in Korea’s history of 5 000 years. He was the greatest of great men, the incarnation of all the best values and qualifications a great man must possess. The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung regarded the people as his God. He dearly loved the people, firmly believed in them, and gave his all for their freedom and happiness, undergoing hardships and   108  sufferings on their behalf throughout his life. The glorious history of our revolution, the dignity and honour of socialist Korea and the happiness of our people are associated with the respected name of the leader, the brilliant results of his great leadership. As a veteran of world statesmanship, the respected Comrade Kim Il Sung gave strength and confidence to the world’s progressive people in their fight for independence, and made an imperishable contribution to the cause of human independence. The respected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung was the great teacher and benevolent father of our people, and all our people are his soldiers and devoted followers, the sons and daughters of the paternal leader. All the generations of our country, from the first generation of our revolution up to the present one, have grown up and led a fruitful life under the leader’s warm care, developing their socio-political integrity. For many years, our people have regarded the respected Comrade Kim Il Sung as a legendary hero, the sun of the nation, a great leader and the nation’s father. They have considered it their greatest honour and noblest moral duty to be single-heartedly loyal and dutiful to him. Our people’s loyalty to the great leader has been displayed even more strongly since he passed away. People throughout the country paid their last respects to the fatherly leader in bitter tears and cherished their memory of him in unabated grief. As time goes by, our people are yearning for him more and more, praying for his immortality with their purest minds. The world is moved by the infinite loyalty and devotion to the great leader our people have displayed before and after his death by believing in him and regarding him invariably as their spiritual pillar. What was most important to us, gripped by the pain of great loss after his sudden death, was to continue to venerate him as much as when he was alive and to carry forward his cause with loyalty. Our Party concentrated all its efforts on the important work of holding the great leader in lasting reverence and carrying forward and developing his revolutionary ideology and cause, and roused the whole Party,   109  entire army and all the people to this end. We have solemnly rebuilt the Kumsusan Memorial Palace as the sacred temple of Juche, reverently laying the respected Comrade Kim Il Sung in state there, and have continued to add glory to the great name of the leader and his immortal accomplishments. Our Party is organizing and mobilizing its members and working people for a vigorous struggle to ensure an impeccable continuity of the great leader’s ideology and leadership and implement his teachings. The leadership of our Party, which invariably and highly respects the great leader and faithfully carries on his ideology and cause, has convinced our people more deeply that the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung will always be with them, and motivated them to strengthen their indomitable revolutionary spirit and will to carry the revolutionary cause of Juche through to completion, true to the leader’s teachings. With a full conviction that as long as our Party exists the great leader’s revolutionary cause is ever-victorious, our people are fighting forcefully, placing unqualified support and trust in the Party and united firmly behind it. Our Party is greatly proud of having such fine people as ours who, with unshakeable outlook on the leader and a noble sense of moral obligation, are loyal to their Party and leader through generations. Our Party and people highly respect the revolutionaries who fought for the revolutionary cause of Juche under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung. The anti-Japanese revolutionary veterans are the honourable first generation of our revolution. They took up arms and started fighting the war, shedding blood, not for their personal interests or fame, but solely for the day when people would live happily on their liberated motherland. The anti-Japanese revolution was unprecedentedly arduous and beset with trials. Under the most trying conditions, the anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters upheld the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung as the centre of their unity, the centre of leadership, and fought by displaying unparalleled heroism and sacrifice. As a result they defeated the Japanese imperialists, accomplished the historic   110  cause of national liberation, and made a brilliant contribution to establishing the glorious revolutionary traditions of our Party. Our Party respects them as the pioneers of our revolution and as model revolutionaries, and sets great store by their revolutionary spirit and exploits. Putting forward the slogan “Let us produce, study and live like the anti-Japanese guerrillas!”, our Party encourages the entire Party membership and working people to emulate the revolutionary spirit and fighting attitude of the anti-Japanese fighters in their work and life, and add glory to their exploits. The participants in the Fatherland Liberation War are the heroic fighters who defended the people’s country by inheriting the brilliant traditions of the anti-Japanese revolution. In the fierce fighting to decide the destiny of the country, our People’s Army and people defeated the US imperialist invaders and defended the freedom and independence of the country with honour. Our Party is very proud of the immortal achievements of our soldiers and people during the Fatherland Liberation War, and educates the younger generation and other people in their mass heroism and patriotic spirit. The heroes and heroines, labour innovators and the front-rankers during the Chollima upsurge in the postwar years belong to the proud generation that brought about a high tide of building socialism, surmounting the obstacles in the way of our revolution. We give prominence to these heroes and heroines, innovators and front-rankers in the Chollima age, as models of self-reliance who, under the leadership of the Party in a short period, built our country into a socialist state–independent, self-sufficient and self-reliant in defence–on the rubble of war in the spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. Our Party continues to glorify the socio-political integrity of the revolutionary and patriotic martyrs and heroic fighters who performed brilliant feats in the different periods of our revolution, thus passing their accomplishments down through history. We have set up the splendid Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery and Patriotic Martyrs Cemetery in their memory, and have named their birthplaces,   111  schools, factories, farms or the units of the People’s Army where they studied or served after these heroes. We give wide publicity to their distinguished services. Our country also spares nothing to take loving care of the children of the revolutionary and patriotic martyrs and heroic soldiers. We have set up schools for the children of revolutionary martyrs in many parts of the country, educating them to be stalwart revolutionaries at state expense; we assign them to the important posts of Party, state and army and help them work well. Our Party and people do this because they see it as their moral obligation to the revolutionary martyrs. In our country many revolutionary and war veterans, disabled soldiers, merited people, renowned intellectuals and other distinguished people in the cultural field still continue to work for the revolution, leading valuable and worthwhile lives under the warmly loving care of the Party and enjoying social concern and respect. To love, respect and give prominence to the revolutionaries and merited people who are loyal to the Party and revolution, country and people–this is the politics of our Party and lofty spirit of our society. Our Party and people also appreciate the people renowned in our nation’s history and keep their accomplishments alive in the nation’s memory. We unearthed the tomb of Tangun, the founder of Korea, and rebuilt it majestically, and splendidly reconstructed the tombs of King Tongmyong, the founder of Koguryo, a powerful ancient state, and of Wang Kon, the founder of Koryo. The long history of our nation has thus acquired greater brilliance in the era of the Workers’ Party. The masses’ cause of independence, the cause of socialism, is a national, and at the same time an international cause. The Korean revolutionaries are genuine internationalists; they respect the revolutionaries, anti-imperialist fighters, anti-fascist fighters, progressive figures and revolutionary people of all countries, irrespective of their nationality, and duly appreciate their achievements.   112  Our Party and people respect Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin as the leaders of the working class and speak highly of their distinguished services. Reflecting the demands and aspirations of the working class, Marx and Engels, the first leaders of the working class, developed socialism from a Utopian concept to a science and started the socialist and communist movement. Lenin inherited and developed Marxism to meet the change in the times and won the victory of the October Socialist Revolution by organizing and mobilizing the working class. Stalin, succeeding to the cause of Lenin, built the first young socialist state into a world power and defended the socialist motherland from the fascist invasion, leading the army and the people. In their days Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin represented the aspirations and demands of the exploited working masses, and the cause of socialism was inseparably linked with their names. The fact that imperialists and the traitors to the revolution viciously defame the leaders of the working class and abuse their leadership as “dictatorship” or “infringement on human rights” only proves that the leaders of the working class were zealous champions of the people’s interests and enjoyed their trust and support, and that they were steadfast communist revolutionaries who held fast to the revolutionary principle without compromising with the enemies of the revolution. Our Party has always assessed the ideological and theoretical achievements of the working-class leaders in an impartial way. It has defended the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism from all manner of opportunistic distortions and inherited and developed them to meet the interests of the revolution and the requirements of the reality. The revolutionary idea and theory of the working class must be applied to meet the historical circumstances and specific situation of each country. The conditions and circumstances of the revolution ceaselessly change and develop. Therefore, if we take a dogmatic approach to the existing theories, we cannot formulate the line and policies correctly, and so cannot avoid twists and turns in the revolution and construction. While adhering to the revolutionary   113  principles of Marxism-Leninism, our Party has established its own guiding ideology and theory on the basis of a correct analysis of the historical limitations of their doctrines, and used them as a weapon in advancing the socialist cause. The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung, in the course of creatively applying Marxism-Leninism to the Korean revolution in his early days, authored the Juche idea and blazed the trail for the independent development of our revolution. The Juche idea is an original idea, which developed the revolutionary idea of the working class to meet the new historical circumstances and the modern-day requirements. The historical limitations of the preceding theories were overcome by the Juche idea, and the revolutionary ideology and theory of the working class developed onto a higher stage. The opportunists and socialist renegades distorted and defamed Marxism-Leninism and disgraced its authors. Modern revisionists emasculated the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism to please the imperialists and thus distorted and corrupted the revolutionary ideology of the working class. The socialist renegades, claiming that the socialist ideal itself was wrong, denied the revolutionary idea of the working class outright. The idea that denies the working-class revolutionary idea cannot be anything but bourgeois ideology. The traitors claimed that they were carrying out “reform” and “restructuring” for “democracy” and “economic welfare,” gainsaying the revolutionary idea of the working class. However, real life has clearly shown that their “theory” was nothing but a reactionary theory for destroying socialism and reviving capitalism. Our people respect not only the leaders of the working class but also the revolutionaries and peoples of all countries who have fought heroically for the socialist cause. We remember the great revolutionary struggles of the peoples in many countries who have rendered distinguished services in the socialist cause. We highly appreciate their historical achievements. Our Party and people oppose and denounce all manner of counterrevolutionary plots and traitorous acts that defame and debase the struggles and achievements of   114  revolutionary forerunners who contributed to the socialist cause. Although the opportunists and the socialist renegades defaced the honour of the leaders of the working class and the revolutionary pioneers, they can never wipe out their names and their worthy achievements from history. Just as socialism is alive in people’s minds and is opening up the path to a new victory in spite of temporary twists and turns, so the honour and accomplishments of the leaders of the working class and the revolutionary forefathers be respected for ever by the people as the socialist movement advances. Our Party and people treasure friendship and solidarity with the peoples of various countries around the world and have given active support and encouragement to people who are fighting for socialism and for the cause of anti-imperialist independence. We have invariably been true to the internationalist principle and revolutionary obligation both in the party and state relations with the socialist countries and in our relations with all the friendly countries and friendly people. We invariably respect the party and state leaders, prominent figures in the political, public, academic and press circles and friends in many countries with whom the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung became intimate during his foreign activities. We remember our revolutionary comrades-in-arms and fraternal people who gave our people disinterested help in the trying years of our revolution, and also people of all countries who support and encourage the just cause of our people. The noble mental and moral qualities of the people are inconceivable without the correct leadership of the party and the leader. Socialist society, where comradely unity and cooperation constitute the basis of social relations, creates the socio-economic conditions for the formation and development of new morals which conform to its intrinsic nature. However, people’s mental and moral qualities do not automatically become noble with the establishment of the socialist system. Even in socialist society, people can acquire noble mental and moral qualities only when they are correctly   115  guided by the party and the leader. The mental and moral qualities of the people take after those of the leader and follow the party’s politics. A great leader and a great party produce a great people. The respected Comrade Kim Il Sung was a great man and the great father of the people who was endowed with the loftiest human love as well as with fervent love for and trust in the people. Our Party is genuinely a maternal party. It leads the people and takes care of them, pursuing the politics of love and trust–benevolent politics–true to the noble idea and virtue of the great leader. The beautiful mental and moral traits of our people were formed and have developed and become ennobled today under the benevolent care of the paternal leader and maternal Party. Thanks to the great personality of the fatherly leader and to the benevolent politics of the motherly Party, our people have acquired a high sense of moral obligation; they love their comrades, respect their revolutionary seniors, are loyal to the Party and the revolution and devote themselves for the society and the collective. Consequently, genuinely communist human relationships based on comradely unity and cooperation, love and trust, have come into bloom in our society. The mental and moral traits of our people clearly show that our socialism, which is centred on the masses of the people, is superior to the capitalist world politically, ideologically, mentally and morally.  3  Establishing the moral traits of respecting one’s revolutionary predecessors and developing sound relations between the people, based on morality and loyalty, is an important task in carrying forward and accomplishing the socialist cause. As the revolution advances and society develops, morality must   116  also develop steadily towards perfection. The consummation of socialism presupposes the perfection of people themselves, the masters of society, and moral consummation holds an important place in the perfection of human qualities. The highest stage in the development of human morals is communist morality. Communist morality is a collectivist morality, based on comradely love and revolutionary loyalty; it is the highest morality, which conforms to man’s intrinsic requirement. Only through the process of eliminating the remnants of outmoded morality still lingering in the people’s minds in socialist society and establishing thoroughly communist morality can people be transformed into people of the communist type and can socialism be accomplished. Defending and carrying forward the revolutionary traditions established by revolutionary predecessors is a revolutionary duty and noble moral obligation for the successors to revolution. The revolutionary idea and spirit of the revolutionary predecessors, the valuable achievements and experience in their struggle and their revolutionary traits are the important contents of the revolutionary traditions which we must inherit and learn down through the generations. The revolutionary traditions are a priceless ideological and mental wealth that provides the continuity of revolutionary lifeblood. Whether the socialist cause advances victoriously through generations, or is abandoned as one generation is replaced by another, can be said to depend on the attitude towards revolutionary traditions. Rejecting revolutionary traditions means renouncing the revolutionary idea and spirit and giving up the revolutionary struggle, and in the long run, leading the revolution to frustration. The experience and lesson of the socialist movement show that neglecting, denying or obliterating the revolutionary traditions will lead a working-class party to inevitable degeneration and destruction, no matter how it boasts of its long history and rich experience in the struggle, and that such a practice will make it impossible for a country to defend socialism no matter how long its history of socialism or how strong its economic and military power.   117  In order to strengthen and develop a working-class party steadily into a revolutionary party and carry forward and accomplish the socialist cause successfully through generations, it is imperative to preserve and put into effect its revolutionary traditions correctly in party building and party activity and in all fields of the revolution and construction. The revolutionary traditions of our Party are the revolutionary traditions of Juche, established by the anti-Japanese forerunners under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung. The glorious revolutionary traditions of Juche are the historical root of our Party and the eternal cornerstone of our revolution. Defending and carrying forward the revolutionary traditions established by the revolutionary predecessors is the way to strengthen and develop our Party for ever into the revolutionary party of a Juche type, defend our socialism and carry forward and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche without fail. We must inherit the lofty revolutionary idea and spirit of the revolutionary predecessors, staunchly adhere to the revolutionary principle, the working-class principle, and advance stoutly along the road of revolution, no matter what the circumstances or conditions. We must ensure that the Party members and other working people equip themselves firmly with the revolutionary traditions of our Party, put them thoroughly into practice and always live and work in a revolutionary manner. We must see that all the Party members and other working people, following the examples of the revolutionary predecessors, make loyalty to the Party and the leader their revolutionary faith and ethics and fight devotedly for the revolutionary cause of Juche under the leadership of the Party. In this way we will bring lasting glory to the revolutionary traditions of Juche, established by the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners and developed by our Party, and keep and demonstrate the honour and dignity of the communist revolutionaries who highly value revolutionary principles and loyalty. We must intensify moral education among Party members and   118  other working people to establish communist moral traits throughout our society. Morality is the social standard of behaviour to be observed voluntarily, with conscience. Therefore, it is only when people acquire noble moral traits with a clear conscience in and out of work that they become revolutionaries, genuine communists truly loyal to the Party and revolution, the country and people, and establish communist moral traits throughout all of society. We must always educate and lead the Party members and other working people to observe communist moral standards in good faith in all aspects of social relations and social life, ranging from loving their parents, brothers, sisters and comrades and helping each other with solicitude, to valuing their communities and organizations, taking good care of state and social property and observing public morals voluntarily. We must pay special attention to educating the younger generation, the successors to the revolution and the masters of the future, to be unfailingly loyal to the Party and revolution. The prosperity of the country and nation and the destiny of socialism depend on how we educate and train the younger generation. The mental and moral qualities of the younger generation reflect the future of their country and nation. It is a historical lesson that even in a socialist society the younger generation are unable to grow up into reliable successors to the revolution, nor can they defend socialism, unless they are given proper education. The youth and children are at the stage of ideological and mental development and they have grown up in easy circumstances without undergoing the trials of revolutionary struggle. Therefore, if they are not given proper education, they may be easily affected with unsound ideology, morality and modes of life. The present mental and moral state of our youth and children is excellent. However, we must never neglect the education of the younger generation on any account. We must teach them to be revolutionaries, communists who follow the Party and the leader with loyalty, are unfailingly faithful to   119  the country and people and equipped with noble, sound mental and moral traits. Giving the younger generation a good education is an important duty of the elder generation. The most valuable heritage that the revolutionary predecessors should hand down to their successors is their mental and moral heritage. The elder generation should bequeath material wealth for a rich life to their posterity, but what is more important is to hand over valuable mental and moral wealth to them so that they reliably succeed to the revolution. We must teach the younger people clearly how the first and second generations of our revolution followed the Party and the leader and how they lived and fought to overcome the difficult revolutionary situation during the arduous anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, the Fatherland Liberation War, and in the years of difficult postwar reconstruction and socialist construction. In this way, we will ensure that all the younger people zealously emulate the same unfailing loyalty to the Party and the leader as was displayed by the first and second revolutionary generations, as well as the latter’s devotion to the revolutionary cause and their indomitable fighting spirit. It is important to enhance the role of youth organizations in educating the younger people. The basic task of the League of Socialist Working Youth is to give the younger generation sound education and train them into the kind of successors to the revolution that are politically and ideologically steadfast and possess a noble moral character. The LSWY organizations must step up education in keeping with the characteristics of young people so that they all grow up into a new revolutionary generation and reliable masters of the future. For sound education, schools, society and families must all join their educational efforts. Schools at all levels, public educational establishments and families must all pay close attention to education so that all young people receive a good grounding in sound, revolutionary living anytime and anywhere. Young people are full of curiosity and responsive, so that everything they see, hear and feel   120  exerts a great influence on their emotions and lives. Therefore, we must pay close attention to their education through mass media such as arts, literature and the press. Moral education in socialist society must conform to the essential characteristics of communist morality and the requirements of developing socialist society. First of all, we must regard moral education as an important part of ideological education and conduct it in close combination with the latter. Ideology and morality are inseparable, and morality is inconceivable apart from ideology. Morality based on the revolutionary idea of the working class is a collectivist, communist morality; morality based on bourgeois reactionary ideology is an ultra-egoistic morality, a reactionary bourgeois morality. Only when a person’s ideology is sound can he acquire a noble moral quality, and only when his ideology is reinforced with his conscience and morality can it be true and unshakeable. We must conduct communist moral education in breadth and depth, considering it as an important part of education in the Juche idea. By intensifying communist moral education on the basis of developing in depth education in the principles of the Juche idea among the Party members and other working people, we must see to it that they firmly absorb the Juche-oriented revolutionary outlook on morality and acquire the best mental and moral traits of a communist revolutionary of the Juche type. We must ensure that people cultivate their communist moral qualities through life in the revolutionary organizations and in their revolutionary practice. People develop their qualities as social beings through collective life in social communities, and life in the revolutionary organizations is the highest form of social collective life. Life in a revolutionary organization is a fine school that trains and educates people both ideologically and morally to acquire communist traits. An important factor that has enabled our people to acquire sound and revolutionary mental and moral qualities lies in the fact that everyone leads his life as part of a particular political   121  organization. We must stimulate the activities of people in a revolutionary organization and establish more firmly the habit of leading the organizational life on a voluntary basis. We must do this to encourage the people to enhance their sense of collectivism, reject all manner of liberalistic and unsound trends and develop noble moral traits. A person’s conscience and sense of moral obligation are expressed and verified in practical activities. An outmoded moral outlook and immoral practices are mainly rooted in obsolete customs. We must see to it that people remain true to their conscience and obligation in their daily work and life and oppose an obsolete moral outlook and conventions, thereby setting up a new socialist way and spirit of life. It is most effective to conduct moral education by the method of educating people through the influence of positive examples and social campaigns. This method is a powerful means, congenial to the nature of socialist society. Among our people are numerous commendable people who unhesitatingly dedicate their lives for their revolutionary comrades, unobtrusively do good things for the Party, the revolution, the society and the collective, and live conscientiously with a loyal and dutiful attitude throughout their lives. They are the incarnation of a clean conscience and noble morality, the models for the people of our era. We must pay a high tribute to the communist traits manifested among these people, give wide publicity to them, and launch a powerful society-wide movement to follow their example. We must fight against obsolete, reactionary morality and any trend of life that runs counter to communist morality, and must prevent their penetration into our ranks. The work of establishing a new communist morality is carried on in the fight against obsolete, reactionary morals and all sorts of immorality and depravity. Bourgeois morality leads people to follow the law of the jungle and degrades them into slaves of money who discard the most elementary human conscience and duty for the sake of cash. In capitalist society, where bourgeois morality rules, every   122  manner of social evil is rampant, and a corrupt and degraded mode of life prevails. The situation is further aggravated by the reactionary ruling circles. The imperialists are extensively spreading their corrupt bourgeois morality and way of life both at home and abroad. We must heighten our vigilance against the ideological and cultural infiltration of the imperialists and completely foil it. We must also have a clear knowledge of the reactionary nature and harmfulness of the treacherous acts of the opportunists who slandered the pioneers of the revolution and abused communist morality, and must staunchly oppose and reject them. The more the imperialists and the renegades from the revolution scheme to slander the communists and abuse communist morality, the higher we must display our revolutionary mettle and the noble moral traits as communist revolutionaries. The history of our revolution, which has advanced under the banner of the Juche idea, led by the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung, is a glorious one. It has been embroidered with revolutionary comradeship and noble moral fidelity and has paved the road of victory in our revolution on the strength of single-hearted unity among the revolutionary ranks. Our Party and people will defend the glorious history and traditions of our revolution and develop them for ever.",seventy year elapse since dawn revolution advance banner juche noble revolution

14.01.1996,Kim Jong Il,"A revolutionary must live not merely for today but for tomorrow. For a revolutionary living and fighting for tomorrow is more important than for today. In my work, I recognize with equanimity any difficulty attendant on my duty, since in my mind I see the prospect of our ever-prospering socialist country and the faces of our people who will enjoy a more worthwhile and fulfilling life in its embrace. “Live not merely for today but for tomorrow!”– this is my outlook on life. It means that one should live with the determination to dedicate oneself to the future of one’s country and the happiness of posterity, even though one may not enjoy any benefits from one’s service. The anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters fought with such an outlook on life, with such a conviction. Our officials should fight heart and soul for the final victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche, cherishing the outlook on life, the conviction, that one must live not merely for today but for tomorrow. The revolution is not completed in one generation; it is a long-term undertaking lasting several generations. Kim Hyong Jik, the father of President Kim Il Sung, put forward the idea Aim High in his early days and composed a song Green Pine on Nam Hill   124  which is run through with the meaningful message that the revolution should be carried out generation after generation. The President inherited his father’s idea of Aim High and developed it further, thus opening up a new path of the Korean revolution. Aim High ran through the President’s ideology and down into mine. No matter how thorny the road of revolution may be, we should accomplish through the generations the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered by our leader President Kim Il Sung, overcoming all the hardships and trials. We should not make the revolution for the sake of our own pleasure. Those who seek immediate pleasure for today cannot make the revolution and may reduce themselves to lagging behind the times. If we want to enjoy pleasure, we should do so only after our people are living happily with nothing to envy in the world and the country is reunified. The President did his utmost to ensure that the people could eat rice and meat soup, dressed in silk and living in tile-roofed houses, and to reunify the country, the supreme desire of the nation. He often went without sleep or rest and eventually worked himself to death. We must, as soon as possible, translate into reality his intention to ensure that our people are living well enough for them to envy nothing in the world, by accelerating the socialist construction by all means, and accomplish without fail the historic cause of national reunification, which was his lifelong desire. To this end, we must strive hard, instead of pursuing personal pleasure. To seek personal comfort now, when our people are not well off and the entire nation is suffering the pain of national division, is behaviour that demonstrates a lack of conscience proper to the times. I do not allow myself any personal comfort. The President instructed that revolutionaries should be content to eat rice with just soybean paste, if they can make a revolution. Our officials should bend every effort to fulfilling their revolutionary tasks, with such a conviction and resolution. The enemy is desperate to conquer our country, the bulwark of socialism.   125  We have manifold difficulties and trials to overcome, as we have to defend socialism single-handed in the face of the imperialists’ encirclement. But we can never backtrack from the course of revolution. A true revolutionary, a communist, must die an honourable and worthy death while making a revolution. To die an honourable death while fighting to the last on the glorious road for the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of Juche is the most worthwhile life for Juche-type communist revolutionaries. No one in the world is our equal if we fight with such a conviction and the courage to defend socialism whatever the trials and hardships, even if it may cost us our lives; then we will see who will have the last laugh. “No one in the world can match a man ready to risk his life”–this is precisely an expression of the conviction and courage required of our revolutionaries. If the Supreme Commander issues an order, everyone should turn out, ready to lay down his or her life in carrying it out. Our officials should be indomitable revolutionary soldiers who thrust themselves forward into the front line at the risk of their lives. All officials should advance bravely, looking far into the future, with full confidence in the victory of the revolution. When we build a factory or undertake a land realignment project, we should draw up an ambitious plan and carry it out boldly, looking 10 years, 50 years or 100 years into the future. Only an official who marches forward bravely, however challenging and however manifold the difficulties facing him or her, looking into the future, can be called an official with full conviction and the Juche-oriented outlook on life. In order to follow the road of revolution unswervingly, cherishing the Juche-oriented outlook on life, one should intensify one’s Party organizational activities, training oneself in a revolutionary way. No turncoat or waverer appears among those who faithfully conduct their Party organizational activities. Experience shows that turncoats and waverers appear among those who are idle in Party organizational activities and who like to distance themselves from Party organizations. Those who pay only lip service to Party organizations   126  and those who shed crocodile tears, should not be judged at face value as loyalists and such. We should live and work cheerfully in order to create a wonderful future, braving even a mountain of trials. Someone with a firm conviction loves the future, and someone who loves the future does not know pessimism. Without revolutionary optimism, one cannot brave the hardships and trials or fight at the risk of one’s life for the future.

22.04.1996,Kim Jong Il,"The economic work of the country is currently not going as it should. However, the state economic organs including the Administration Council have not put forward proper suggestions for measures to shore up the economy. Some leading economic officials are neither racking their brains nor displaying creativity to solve the problems facing the economy. I am engaged with Party work and military affairs, so I cannot concern myself with each and every problem arising in economic management. Economic officials must take charge of economic work. Now that we have an advantageous socialist system, a militant party and people who are loyal to the Party and industrious, there is no reason why we cannot solve our economic problems. It is a fact that economic work is facing a not insignificant number of challenges, with the imperialists intensifying their economic blockade and the socialist market having disappeared. But if we organize economic work efficiently and enlist the inexhaustible creative strength of the masses, we are fully able to tide over the immediate challenges. The problem is how our economic officials use their brains and manage the economy in conformity with the new environment. They, fully aware of their mission and duty, should devote their energy and wisdom to improving economic work.   146  Before anything else, guidance to farming should be improved in line with the requirements of the actual situation, so as to increase grain output. The agriculture-first policy is the consistent policy of our Party and the primary task in our revolutionary economic strategy. In recent years, farming has not been done well, and this has placed an unprecedented strain on the food situation. A major reason for the poor farming is the failure of our officials to guide farming in conformity with the actual situation in the country. Of course, in our country the weather conditions are unfavourable for farming and the area of farmland is limited. In contrast with the Southeast Asian countries which cultivate two or three crops a year, it is difficult for us to grow two crops a year. In the farming season, sometimes it is dry and sometimes it is rainy, causing floods. Our country is not very large territorially and is mountainous. Viewed from an aircraft, mountains can be seen covering the whole land. Foreigners in the past wondered how our country, a mountainous one, could achieve self-sufficiency in food. We cannot attribute the poor farming in recent years only to the unfavourable natural and geographical conditions. If these conditions are unfavourable, we ought to transform nature and develop appropriate farming methods. With keen insight into the natural and geographical conditions in our country, President Kim Il Sung a long time ago presented the policy of rezoning crop fields while giving priority to irrigation. Under his wise leadership our country became well known around the world as a country of irrigation. Irrigation is a key condition for developing agriculture. Having long ago focused on irrigation under his leadership, we increased grain output on our limited arable land and attained self-sufficiency in food. Our officials should have followed up the success of irrigation associated with his efforts and made it more effective, but they have failed to do so. When putting forward the irrigation policy, the President said that not only damage from drought should be prevented by building   147  irrigation works, but also damage from flooding should be prevented by improving the rivers and forests, and drainage. Officials have neither conserved the rivers and forests properly nor taken measures to improve drainage. The poor farming in recent years is also related with subjectivism and bureaucratism revealed in officials’ guidance to farming. In the past they compelled their subordinates to expand the land under grain cultivation on the plea of attaining self-sufficiency in food. It is natural that we should attain self-sufficiency in food by producing large quantities of grain. But it is wrong to enforce the planting of grain crops even on infertile land. Grain production cannot be increased in this way and it will make it impossible to earn money for buying grain by planting other crops and selling them. It is better to plant medicinal herbs or mulberry trees on land that is unsuitable for maize cultivation and earn foreign currency to import grain. When I went to North Hamgyong Province, I said that medicinal herbs should be planted, not grain crops, in conformity with the features of the region where grain crops do not grow well. It seems my words are not being heeded. In some areas of the province, it is far more economical to cultivate and sell medicinal herbs and import grain than to cultivate maize, the yield of which is poor. We should utilize the country’s natural and geographical conditions to the maximum and make exact economic calculations. It is wrong for officials to demand the expansion of the land under grain cultivation without any calculation. A grain production plan should be formulated on the basis of detailed considerations of the actual conditions. In order to increase grain output, officials should have a correct view of the Juche method of farming and meet its demands properly. The Juche method of farming created by President Kim Il Sung is a scientific method of doing farm work in conformity with the country’s climatic and soil conditions, the biological features of crops and the detailed conditions of every plot; it is a most superior method of ensuring high and stable yields. Planting the right crop in the right soil is a demand of the Juche method of farming. But officials in the agricultural sector impose on their subordinate units technical data   148  obtained from test fields, not from the crop fields at cooperative farms, claiming that they are following the Juche method of farming. However, this runs counter to the demands of the Juche method of farming. It is impossible to increase output by forcing cooperative farms to plant uniformly seeds that have been tested only in test plots. Fertilizer and everything else needed can be provided for the test plots, but it is difficult to do so for the plots at cooperative farms. If a strain is planted that requires a lot of fertilizer and if it is not applied in a sufficient amount, the yield will be lower than other strains. To do farming in keeping with the actual conditions, the opinions of the farmers should be respected and their role enhanced. The masters of farming are the farmers, and those who know well how to do farm work are the farmers. Cooperative farms have many agricultural engineers and assistant engineers. The farmers, who are familiar with the actual conditions, should be encouraged to do farm work in a responsible manner as befitting masters. If officials, who are not familiar with the conditions at the lower units, order them to plant this or that crop, farm work cannot be done well. The strains developed by agricultural scientists should not be imposed on them; they should be planted and cultivated in farm fields, so that farmers can accept them of their own accord. Not only the seeds but also the method of farming should not be imposed uniformly. As the conditions differ from one farm to another and from one plot to another, imposing a uniform method of farming may adversely affect the crop yield. In order to increase grain output in our country, where the land under cultivation is limited, we should expand the area of arable land. In the past, we have reclaimed tidelands and brought new land under cultivation, but there are still many areas of land that can be reclaimed. Rezoning is a way of obtaining new land for cultivation. Some fields have been rezoned, but there are still more paddy and non-paddy fields to be improved. Land rezoning will enable us to bring more land under cultivation and will be conducive to mechanizing the rural economy. Backward farming methods are still practised in many parts of the countryside. We should rezone fields to create standardized shapes and   149  remove the rocks from them to permit mechanized farm work. True, we are short of machinery and fuel at present, but we should have an eye to the future. We should further develop the rural economy into a modernized, socialist rural economy. This year is forecasted to be dry. Thoroughgoing measures should be taken for preventing damage from drought such as attracting as much water as possible to the reservoirs, and maintaining irrigation installations in a good state of repair. Because of the abnormal weather phenomena, we may have heavy rain during the droughts, so measures should also be taken to prevent damage from flooding. Foreign trade should be improved in conformity with the changed situation. Today, when the socialist market has disappeared, if we fail to improve our foreign trade we can neither carry out the Party’s foreign-trade-first policy nor develop foreign trade itself. The leading officials in the Administration Council and other economic sectors, however, continue to work as before when they were dealing with the socialist market. Foreign trade officials, too, do not know how to conduct foreign trade on the capitalist market, apparently because they are used to dealing with the socialist market. Our current export items are not much different from the past. They are lead, zinc, magnesia clinker, cement and steel. It is true that these items generate lots of money if they are exported, but to export the country’s valuable resources alone is an expression of neglecting the future of the country and the prospective development of its economy, and behaviour that is devoid of patriotism. In exporting mineral resources, we should not sell them as they are but process them to earn much more money. Since we have a lot to build, cement is too valuable to be exported. It is the same case with steel; exporting it to other countries does not stand to reason when we are not running our machine-building factories properly. Since we should deal mainly with the capitalist market, unlike the days when there was the socialist market, we should be bold in readjusting our export structure and our foreign trade mode. This is   150  all the more necessary when we are having to make active inroads into the capitalist market in the situation of the intensified economic blockade by the US imperialists against our country. Our people, who are intelligent and talented, are good at making things that require dexterity and hard work. The developed capitalist countries are not willing to make goods that demand a lot of labour because of the high labour costs. Our women are meticulous and dexterous, so they are able to assemble light electrical appliances far better than people in other countries. Our people are also proficient at making straw goods and various other handiwork items. Straw goods are said to be popular, and other countries earn a lot of foreign currency by selling them. However, our officials think it is not worthwhile or lucrative to make and export such things as straw goods. In recent years the light industry sector has developed the clothing industry, and the garments made in our country have become popular in the developed capitalist countries. If we produce and export various traditional agricultural produce, we can earn a lot of money. The production of light industry goods and traditional agricultural produce does not require much electricity. Instead of trying to export such goods as straw goods and handiwork items, our officials only try to export large goods. However, the production of these large goods is not going smoothly owing to the shortages of electricity, raw materials and fuel. They should think of producing those items that use less electricity and fuel and that can be made from our local raw materials. It is necessary to conduct bonded processing trade, which is a way of earning a considerable sum of money. We can conduct this kind of trade on a full scale as we have many factories and a skilled labour force. It is wrong for some of our officials to regard conducting bonded processing trade as shameful. If we make our country prosperous and improve the people’s standard of living by conducting foreign trade on a wide scale and developing the economy, it will enhance the dignity of our nation. We have the firm foundations of an independent national economy. In recent years south Korea has been talking about the   151  development of its economy. We should not harbour any illusions about it, and should have a correct understanding of its colonial dependence and lack of balance. The south Korean economy is in the hands of the multinationals of the United States and other countries, and as such it is an economy with no independent foundation. As we have the solid foundations of an independent national economy, we should increase our production of export goods and develop foreign trade by relying on them. The line of building an independent national economy does not call for attaining self-sufficiency in everything. President Kim Il Sung long ago said that we should not try to produce everything by ourselves on the plea of building an independent national economy, and he added that we should produce goods whose production conditions are favourable, export them and in exchange import what we lack. A precondition of a self-supporting economy is satisfying each other’s needs, something that is essential for any country. If our officials study deeply and utilize the existing foundations of an independent national economy, they will be fully able to increase the production of export goods and develop foreign trade. Developing our trade with capitalist countries will not mean weakening the independent foundations of our economy or getting mixed up with the capitalist economy. With a broad view conforming with the changed situation, we should develop the country’s economy and reform our export structure. It is necessary to study the world economy and the capitalist market. Our officials pretend to know what they do not and to have what they have not, and do not study the world economy and capitalist market. They are wrong. They should not ignore the experiences of other countries on the plea of establishing the Juche orientation. They should study how to conduct trade with capitalist countries more effectively and thus carry out the Party’s foreign-trade-first policy. We have to trade with the capitalist market, and it is impossible for us to do so well without understanding the capitalist market and world economy. I have had a research institute set up under the State Planning Commission, and other research organs established. But officials   152  show no proper interest in them. The administrative and economic organs and economic institutes should do their work well in conformity with the changed situation, and present proposals conducive to carrying out the Party’s revolutionary economic strategy and developing the country’s economy. Close attention should be paid to expanded reproduction as a way of achieving an uninterrupted increase in production. Expanded reproduction is a law-governed demand of economic development. However, leading economic officials pay no attention to it. When foreign currency has been earned, some officials do not think of expanding export bases, using these earnings as an asset. The failure to increase production in some industrial fields, such as the metallurgical industry and chemical industry, can be attributed to the way the leading officials in these fields, who are bent on satisfying immediate needs without any consideration of expanded reproduction, work. If leading officials work from one day to the next, we can expect neither expanded reproduction nor economic development. Overhauling factories on time is a major guarantee for reproduction, and technical upgrading is an inevitable demand of the developing economy. In order to normalize and increase production continuously, equipment should be repaired and renovated promptly. But factories and enterprises are failing to do so. Chemical factories ought to explore their export resources, sell them abroad and import pipes for renovating their equipment, but they are not doing it well. The situation at factories in other fields is the same. This being the situation, how can production be normalized and steadily increased? The greatest fault on the part of economic officials is that they pay no attention to technical upgrading. Many of them think only of how to maintain the status quo with outdated equipment. We cannot raise our country’s industry to the world standard in this way in the present era when science and technology are developing ceaselessly. We should abandon that which is outdated as boldly as we blew up the   153  arc furnace in the past, and introduce new technology on a wide scale. Recently it was reported to me that a method of making paper by using glauberite instead of caustic soda had been developed. If we strive to introduce new technology, we can solve any problem. All sectors should maintain materials in reserve. We can neither maintain the country’s independence nor develop its economy if we do not have materials in reserve. Though everything is in short supply and we face many obstacles at present, we should create an adequate store of materials in reserve even if it means tightening our belts. The enemy hopes we have nothing in reserve. It is a good strategy for a military commander to have a reserve force. Without such a force, he cannot be victorious over the enemy. The logic is the same in the development of the national economy. Without materials in reserve, the economy of a country cannot make stable progress. The economic sector should maintain materials in reserve to provide against possible natural disasters and new situations which might call for additional supplies. However, the Administration Council and the State Planning Commission are attempting to run the national economy with nothing in reserve. Some officials use up the materials in reserve instead of making efforts to overcome the difficulties. However difficult the situation is, we must have necessary materials in reserve. Discipline should be observed in planning so that reasonable plans can be drawn up. The socialist economy is a planned economy. But discipline is currently lacking in planning; national economic plans are worked out without guarantees. Such plans make it impossible to develop the economy. It is a criminal act of deceiving the Party and state and creating confusion in the economy, to work out unrealistic plans. Leading economic officials should enhance their sense of responsibility and role in order to conduct their work substantially. To all intents and purposes, they should undertake economic work on their own responsibility. If they do not do their work responsibly as befitting masters, they cannot develop the country’s economy. The   154  main reason why economic work is currently not proceeding as it should is their failure to do their work responsibly as befitting masters. Under the wise leadership of President Kim Il Sung, we built many modern factories and enterprises. If they are run efficiently, our people can live in prosperity. However, owing to the irresponsible behaviour of leading economic officials, they are not proving their worth. Few provincial cornstarch factories and riced corn mills are operating properly, and the refrigerating facilities built with lots of equipment and materials in North and South Hamgyong provinces are not being put to good use. Breeding grounds for kelp and mussels were established amid much fanfare, but they have not proved effective. A major shortcoming in the way our officials work is that they create a big fuss about the immediate outcome when they start doing something, but fail to ensure that it continues to pay off. This way of working should be eliminated decisively among leading economic officials. Because some of them have worked irresponsibly, people do not believe what they say. This is tantamount to separating the Party from the masses. Officials in the economic field should work as substantially as their counterparts in the munitions industry. The munitions industry is the most substantial sector in our country. It is an imperishable great achievement of President Kim Il Sung to have built a strong munitions industry. Under the wise leadership of the Party and leader, our working class and service personnel built the industry by tightening their belts, and the officials and workers in this sector are working substantially with a high sense of responsibility. Among leading economic officials, there are few who work with such strenuous exertion as the officials in the munitions industry. If other officials had worked persistently with such a sense of responsibility as those in the munitions industry, their sectors would have much more developed than they are now. We should give full play to the advantages of the socialist system in order to shore up the country’s economy at an early date and   155  fundamentally solve the problem of the people’s livelihood. The Party’s policy is correct and the people are unfailingly faithful to the Party, so the key is how responsibly officials discharge their revolutionary duties. Leading economic officials should carry out the instructions of President Kim Il Sung in deeds, not in words, and render a contribution to the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of Juche. We should get rid of the tendency of giving praise to our own things in information work. We should give realistic education to cadres, Party members and other working people, based on the reality. I have several times stressed the need to ensure truthfulness, scientific accuracy and accessibility in the Party’s information work. We should refrain from praising ourselves in information work. If information work is done in this way, it will lack substance. In information work, we should give wide publicity to the people who are displaying patriotic devotion for the prosperity of the socialist country, and popularize the best examples. This year the Korean People’s Army marks the 64th anniversary of its founding. There are not many countries in the world with armed forces with as long a history as ours. April 25, when President Kim Il Sung founded our revolutionary armed forces, must be celebrated as a national holiday. President Kim Il Sung founded the revolutionary armed forces and led them in the struggle to liberate the country, defend its freedom and independence and safeguard socialism. In this sense, the history of his revolutionary activities is the history of army building. In order to further honour his revolutionary achievements, April 25 should be instituted as a national holiday. Then, it will deepen the service personnel’s sense of honour in standing at the posts of national defence and enhance the importance cadres and other working people attach to military affairs. Instituting April 25 as a national holiday will also be good as various celebratory events can be held and people’s delegations can visit army units on that day.",currently go organ include

14.10.1996,Kim Jong Il,"We should ensure that all officials live and work in the spirit of the Arduous March. To meet the demands of the prevailing situation and present developments, the Party has presented the slogan that cadres, Party members and other working people should live and work in the spirit of the Arduous March. This spirit is the staunch, undaunted revolutionary spirit which saved the Korean revolution and brought about a great upsurge in it during the most severe period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle fought under the command of General Kim Il Sung. At the end of the 1930s, when the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle was experiencing its harshest difficulties, the General put forward the wise strategic and tactical policy of creating a great upsurge in the Korean revolution, and he led the unprecedented Arduous March to victory. Thus he opened a new phase in the struggle for the liberation of the country and the victory of the revolution. The Party has put forward the slogan of living and working in the spirit of the Arduous March to ensure that all cadres, Party members and other working people overcome the current difficulties, and bring about a fresh turn in all fields of the revolution and construction in the   228  same spirit of defending the leader, spirit of self-reliance, spirit of overcoming trials, and revolutionary optimism as that displayed by the anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters during the Arduous March. In other words, the aim is to encourage all the people to display the might of our single-hearted unity and our style of socialism to a higher degree, by bravely overcoming the trials and difficulties facing them and achieving fresh progress in socialist economic construction and all other fields. In order to live and work in this spirit, we must break through the difficulties and advance forcefully, and not merely put up with them. However, it seems to me that some officials mistakenly think that this slogan calls for them simply to put up with the present trials and difficulties. The harder the times are, the harder officials should work and the more effort they should make to carry out the impossible, as required by this slogan put forward by the Party. But some find comfort in the thought that they can do nothing in the days of the Arduous March. A problem at the moment is that some officials are not trying to carry out even what is possible, on the plea of the difficult conditions in the country. Some cities and counties are not even running their noodle houses properly; this is attributable more to the ideological state of officials than to the strained food situation. In the cities and counties whose senior officials are trying hard to solve the problems and manage the life of their units scrupulously, everything is going well, and the noodle houses and the like are operating on a regular basis. I heard that the noodle houses in Taehongdan and Unnyul counties are always open to customers. It is necessary to study the merits of the units where things are going well. It would be advisable to launch a struggle to rectify, by means of the good examples set by these units, the wrong ideological viewpoint and way of thinking of officials who do not engage in their work properly, being steeped in defeatism on the pretext of the country’s difficult situation. All officials should make a new advance in the revolution and construction, overcoming the difficulties and hardships by their own   229  effort, in response to the Party’s call to live and work in the spirit of the Arduous March. We are now building socialism under very difficult circumstances, and many problems are urgently awaiting a solution. Officials should stand in the vanguard of the Arduous March, and uphold the Party with practical achievements. The present situation demands officials who are men of action, officials of the Kim Chaek type, who find solutions to difficult problems by organizing work down to the last detail, and who are not empty talkers or worriers. Kim Chaek, while in charge of economic affairs after the liberation of the country, solved the problems arising in economic affairs and the people’s lives by throwing himself into his work and organizing every type of work assiduously, even though the country’s economic situation at that time was not good. If officials work as Kim Chaek did, they will be fully able to solve any problem. Officials should not simply worry over and complain about problems, but throw themselves into solving them and organize work methodically so that they can be solved quickly. All officials, Party members and other working people should work with revolutionary optimism and full of confidence. However trying the current Arduous March may be, it cannot be compared with the days of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, the Fatherland Liberation War, and postwar reconstruction. President Kim Il Sung pioneered the revolution with nothing but his bare hands and, in the long run, achieved a brilliant victory. Since we have the solid economic foundations he laid down, there is no excuse for us not to overcome the hardships and carry the revolution forward to victory. I, no matter how severe the situation is, never grow pessimistic; the more difficult and complicated the situation is, the more optimistically and cheerfully I undertake to carry out my work. I am determined to advance head-on, whatever the adversity. What I learned from Supreme Commander Kim Il Sung when I was staying at the Supreme Headquarters during the Fatherland Liberation War was revolutionary optimism, and the will and tactics with which to   230  advance head-on. Officials should never lose confidence, but advance with an eye to the future. Hold High the Red Flag is a good song. It describes our faith, will and ideals, and instils strength, courage and confidence in revolutionaries. Its lyric is excellent. We must follow the road of the revolution staunchly, under the leadership of the Party while singing this song out loud. Party organizations and Party workers should conduct proper political guidance over the implementation of Party policy. Success in the inner-Party work should find expression in the implementation of Party policy. Recently, the Party has stressed the importance of creating grasslands and raising grass-eating domestic animals on an extensive basis. Party organizations and Party workers should not confine themselves to organizing the work for implementing Party policy. They cannot carry out a Party policy if they work by simply conveying it to subordinate units, forcing them to do as the policy demands, and calling them to account now and then for their failure to do so properly. While conducting organizational and political work down to the last detail for thoroughly implementing the directives of the Party, they should stand in the vanguard and set practical examples for the masses. Since farming this year has been done with a great deal of effort, Party organizations and Party workers should organize and conduct effective education among the farmers so that not a single grain of rice is wasted.",ensure official live spirit arduous march meet demand prevail situation present development party present slogan cadre party member work live spirit arduous march spirit staunch undaunted revolutionary spirit save revolution bring upsurge during severe period anti japanese revolutionary struggle fight command general sung end anti japanese revolutionary struggle experience harsh difficulty general put forward wise strategic tactical create upsurge revolution lead unprecedented arduous march victory open new phase struggle liberation victory revolution party put forward slogan live work spirit arduous march ensure cadre party member work overcome current difficulty bring fresh turn field revolution same spirit defend leader spirit self reliance spirit overcome trial revolutionary optimism display anti japanese revolutionary fighter during arduous march word aim encourage display single hearted style socialism high degree bravely overcome trial difficulty face achieve fresh progress socialist field order live spirit break difficulty advance forcefully merely put seem official mistakenly think slogan call simply put present trial difficulty hard time hard official effort impossible require slogan put forward party find comfort thought nothing day arduous march problem moment official try possible plea difficult condition city county run noodle house properly attributable official than strained food situation city county whose senior official try hard solve problem manage life unit scrupulously everything go noodle house operate regular basis hear noodle house taehongdan unnyul county always open customer necessary study merit unit thing go advisable launch struggle rectify mean example set these unit wrong viewpoint thinking official engage properly be steep defeatism pretext difficult situation official new advance revolution overcome difficulty hardship own effort response party call live spirit arduous march now build socialism difficult circumstance problem urgently await solution official stand vanguard arduous march uphold party practical achievement present situation demand official man action official chaek type find solution difficult problem organize down last detail empty talker worrier chaek while charge affair liberation solve problem arise affair life throw himself into organize type assiduously situation official chaek fully able solve problem official simply worry over complain problem throw themselves into solve organize methodically solve quickly official party member work revolutionary optimism full confidence try current arduous march compare day anti japanese revolutionary struggle fatherland liberation war postwar reconstruction sung pioneer revolution nothing bare hand long run achieve brilliant victory since solid foundation lay down there excuse overcome hardship revolution forward victory matter severe situation never grow pessimistic difficult complicated situation optimistically cheerfully undertake determined advance head whatever adversity learn supreme commander sing stay supreme headquarters during fatherland liberation war revolutionary optimism tactic advance head official never lose confidence advance eye future hold red flag song describe faith ideal instil strength courage confidence revolutionary lyric excellent follow road revolution staunchly leadership party while singe song loud party organization party worker conduct proper political guidance over implementation party success inner party find expression implementation party recently party stress importance create grassland raise grass eat domestic animal extensive basis party organization party worker confine themselves organize implement party party simply convey subordinate unit force demand call account now then failure properly while conduct organizational political down last detail thoroughly implement directive party stand vanguard set practical example masse since farming do deal effort party organization party worker organize conduct effective farmer single grain rice waste
01.01.1997,Kim Jong Il,"Today we greet the new year with great pride in having firmly defended socialism in the arduous struggle. As we ring in the new year, which marks the third anniversary of President Kim Il Sung’s death, my determination grows afresh to carry forward his cause, and I look back upon what we achieved last year while advancing in the face of severe trials. We experienced many unbearable trials and heartbreaking events last year. The manoeuvres of the imperialists and reactionaries to stamp out socialism in our country grew more vicious, and the hardships we endured in economic construction were beyond description. The hardships and trials caused by the shortage of food and by the anti-DPRK and anti-socialist schemes of the enemy were truly indescribable, and it was truly difficult to overcome them. For all that, we could not turn to anyone for help. So severe was the struggle, I said that it could be compared to the Arduous March of the days of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. The trials and hardships we faced last year, however severe they were, could not halt the march of our people, who were advancing under the red flag, united in one mind around the Party. Under the leadership of the Party, our people hardened their indomitable spirit  232 and revolutionary fighting will and bravely overcame the hardships they faced, and thus achieved miraculous successes in the revolution and construction. Many structures, such as the Anbyon Youth Power Station, a monumental edifice of our age, were built, and many sectors of the national economy, by displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, laid the foundations for us to live independently even under the enemy’s blockade. Many factories and enterprises overfufilled their national economic plans by tapping all their internal reserves, a fresh turn was brought about in land management, and a mass movement was launched to create grasslands and raise grass-eating domestic animals. In the course of the severe struggle to advance against all the odds, the revolutionary faith and will of our people were further strengthened and their determination to support and follow the Party became purer. The farmers of Workteam No. 7 at the Yangdong Cooperative Farm in Unpha County, North Hwanghae Province, when they heard that I was concerned about the shortage of grain, sent me a letter, in which they wrote that they would become Kim Je Wons of the 1990s and call on me with 12 tons of rice as a sign of their patriotism. I was moved by that letter. After the liberation of the country Kim Je Won came to President Kim Il Sung with 30 sacks of rice he had harvested from land distributed to him, and donated them to the country. Highly appreciative of his patriotic deed, the President invited him to his own house and encouraged him; he also sent a personal letter of thanks to Kim Je Won and all other farmers in Jaeryong County. This is recorded in the annals of our Party’s history, and today it is very praiseworthy that the farmers of Workteam No. 7 at the Yangdong Cooperative Farm in Unpha County should appeal to the whole country to become Kim Je Wons of the 1990s and donate rice to the country out of patriotism. What a great appeal it is! It is an outburst of the ardent patriotism and faithfulness felt by our people. In answer to their call, the farmers at the Kim Je Won Cooperative Farm in Jaeryong County and the Ryongchon Cooperative Farm in Hwangju County and other farmers all over the country are donating  233 rice to the country. Through this one fact alone, we can see how faithful our people are to their Party. Our people are truly excellent. The people have risen up as one with a renewed fighting spirit, saying that this is the year of the final offensive in the Arduous March. This reflects their expectation that we will bring the Arduous March to an end, as well as their firm will to bring it to a successful conclusion in response to the Party’s call. This shows that our people fully trust the Party. Our people have experienced really hard trials during the three years of the Arduous March. This year we must bring the Arduous March to a successful conclusion at all costs, and thus prove ourselves worthy of the people’s desires and expectations. Nothing is more worthwhile and honourable for us than to prove ourselves worthy of the people’s desires and expectations. In order to overcome the current difficulties and bring the Arduous March to a successful conclusion this year, we must bring about a revolutionary turn in Party work. Party work nowadays is out of step with the demands of the situation. Party political work is conducted effectively in the army, but not in society. I felt this during my recent visits to military and civilian units. Last year I inspected units of the People’s Army along the east and west coasts, and yesterday Unit 938. Today I visited Mangyongdae Revolutionary School. On these visits, I saw their amateur art performances, and I noticed that the same idea ran through them all. The performances were brimming over with the determination to defend the leadership of the revolution unto death, and with militant mettle and a fighting will. In particular, whenever I enjoy a performance by the Merited Chorus of the Korean People’s Army Song and Dance Ensemble, it evokes a new feeling in me and gives me great encouragement. This can be called our strength and mettle. I am very proud of having such a wonderful chorus. However, amateur art performances staged recently by students have lacked strength and vigour. When soldiers are compared with  234 students, they differ from each other although they are all young. This shows the difference between how the Party organizations conduct political work in the People’s Army and in society. There is nothing we cannot do if Party work is effective. But if it is not effective, we can neither strengthen the Party nor maintain its existence; and worse still, we may bring the revolution and construction to ruin. Some officials talk about economic work separated from the Party’s leadership; they are misguided. Solving the problems that arise in economic work and the people’s lives on its own responsibility is the consistent principle of our Party. Since our Party is a political leadership organization, success in the revolution and construction depends on how we conduct Party work. Party organizations and Party workers must enhance their consciousness and conduct Party work in conformity with the requirements of the situation, so as to open a new, radical phase in the revolution and construction. For this, Party workers should go deep among the masses and conduct vigorous political work. If we are to promote the revolution and construction successfully, we should motivate the masses, their masters, and in doing this, the most powerful weapon is political work. There is no weapon other than political work that can motivate the masses. The basic way to break through the current difficulties and bring the Arduous March to a successful conclusion is to believe in the masses, go deep among them and launch a vigorous political drive among them. The people believe in the Party as in heaven, and we should believe in them as in heaven. That the people believe in the Party and vice versa–herein lies the basic guarantee for the single-hearted unity of the leader, the Party and the masses, and the secret of all our victories. In the past, our Party, whenever it faced difficulties in the revolution and construction, overcame them by going deep among the masses and motivating them, and our people experienced in their actual life that only when they fought with firm trust in the Party and the leader could they break through any difficulties and turn adversity  235 into blessing. It was the same case during the grim Fatherland Liberation War and postwar reconstruction. The year 1956 was a year of ordeals, when the US imperialists and their south Korean puppets were frantically clamouring for a march north while the great-power chauvinists were bringing pressure to bear on the Party and the anti-Party counterrevolutionaries, who had been hiding in its ranks, openly challenged the Party in a conspiracy with outside forces. At that time President Kim Il Sung went among the workers in Kangson and other people, and overcame the difficulties by motivating them; and our people, firmly trusting the leader and the Party, rose up as one and brought about a great revolutionary upsurge. The people believe in the Party and the Party believes in them, and together they break through difficulties, united as one–this is our brilliant tradition. When Party workers go among the people, they will be able to gain fresh courage and strength and discover methods and ways of breaking through any difficulties. I always go among the soldiers and workers and gain strength from their revolutionary and militant spirit and cheerful disposition, and in the course of this I formulate plans for developing my work in a fresh way. This is why I visit the soldiers at frontline posts from time to time, and went to the workers in Kangdong. Recently, Party workers have gained a lot of good experience in the course of conducting vigorous political work among the masses in the same way that it was done on the front line; they have informed the masses of the Party’s intentions and the country’s situation and held open-hearted discussion with them on how to solve their problems, true to my instructions of December 7 last year. That a large internal reserve was discovered for solving the problems in coal production, and that an appeal was issued by the farmers to become Kim Je Wons of the 1990s are a testament to the effectiveness of the Party workers’ political work among the masses. Experience shows that if officials go deep among the masses and actively conduct political work that plucks at their heartstrings, any hardship can be overcome, however difficult and complicated the situation may be.  236 Party workers should be bold in getting rid of the outdated method of work, such as regarding it as fulfilling their duties if they tick names in the roll-call for study sessions and collect and report to their superiors the problems that have arisen at lower units. They should conduct vigorous political work among the masses by going among them and sharing weal and woe with them, as appropriate during the period of the Arduous March. Political work today should be done in the same way that it was done on the front line. The prevailing situation demands that Party workers conduct political work in a militant manner. As I said on December 7 last year, Party workers should go among the masses with bullhorn in hand and conduct political work in the same way that it was done on the frontline, to inspire them to create a revolutionary upsurge. Information and motivational work should be conducted vividly and truthfully in conformity with the requirements of the situation, and not by beautifying the reality. If the reality is beautified, people may not realize what hardships we have overcome in building socialism. We should inform the people not only of the brilliant successes we have achieved in socialist construction but also of the arduous struggle we have waged to achieve those successes, so that they can surmount the present difficulties with an indomitable will. In Party work this year, efforts should be concentrated on solving the problems that most upset the people. Sharing weal and woe with the people and solving their problems is an intrinsic demand of our Party. Our Party regards it as a consistent policy and fundamental principle to give prominence to the people and subordinate everything to their interests. Even when building a single street, we have built it on the principle of placing people at the centre of every consideration and subordinating everything to their interests. In Washington or New York in the United States, and in other cities in the capitalist countries banks, hotels and various entertainment facilities are built in the centre for the convenience of the rich, but in our country high-rise blocks of  237 flats and such public-service facilities as shops and public bathhouses for ordinary people are found in the city centre. In Pyongyang for example, the offices of almost all the public organs are distributed in the less conspicuous areas of the city and high-rise blocks of flats and facilities serving the population stand side by side in the centre. This is why poets write that happy songs sung by the people stream out of brightly-lit houses. When our officials suggested to President Kim Il Sung that a government building be erected on Namsan Hill, the best location in central Pyongyang, he did not approve it; he later had the Grand People’s Study House, where everyone can study, built on the site. This is a clear example, which shows a fundamental difference between the people-centred socialism of our own style and capitalism, and also the people-oriented policy of our Party that serves the people. With pride in the fact that the people-centred socialism of our own style is the most advantageous social system in the world, we should build a people’s paradise on this land, not by copying others, but in our own way. Because our Party always gives the first consideration to the people’s interests and bestows every affection and solicitude on them, our people trust and follow the Party with utmost sincerity. That we are blessed by the people is not something that has been presented to us on a silver platter, but secured by President Kim Il Sung and the Party. Many years have passed since the Party put forward the slogan “We serve the people!” but quite a number of officials still pay only lip service to it, and do the opposite in practice. They pay no heed to the people’s troubles, and instead seek privileges for themselves. If officials share weal and woe with the people and faithfully serve them, the revolution will advance and the country will be prosperous; if they lord it over the people, they will be forsaken by them and ruin themselves. This is a serious lesson taught by the socialist movement in other parts of the world. As I have said several times before, socialism collapsed and capitalism was restored in some countries because their ruling parties had failed to strike root deep among the masses and instead lorded it  238 over them and forfeited their support. Only politics that is supported by the people is correct politics, and can prove viable in practice. Since the masses are the makers of history, Party workers must work for them and serve them. They should understand that if they ignore the lessons of history and lord it over the people, they will be punished by them. Party workers should be fully aware that they will enjoy the people’s absolute support and emerge victorious in the revolution only when they work for them and serve them, and should therefore become true servants of the people. This year, we should launch an extensive drive to thoroughly establish a revolutionary view of the masses throughout the Party and to solve the problems facing the people. We should also see to it that all units direct their efforts to implementing the Party’s policy of managing their own economic life, and ensure that this policy pays off. The more difficult the situation, the more methodically all units should run their economic life; only then can we be better off. Last year the Party stressed the importance of growing mushrooms, creating grasslands on a large scale to raise goats and other grass-eating domestic animals in large numbers and building greenhouses to produce a variety of vegetables in large quantities. Party organizations should carry out these tasks on their own responsibility. Party organizations should organize Party guidance to economic work to the last detail as appropriate to the period of the Arduous March, so as to bring about a turn on all the fronts of socialist construction and decisively improve the people’s standard of living this year. In order to bring about a revolutionary turn in Party work, all Party workers should redouble their efforts with a fresh determination. Party workers constitute the core force of our Party and undertake Party work. The destiny of our Party and the success of its work depend on them. Party workers should ceaselessly think and study, and make effort after effort with high enthusiasm and a passion for their work. If they  239 are always studying their work and making efforts, Party work and economic work will be effective. When counties where the local people are relatively well-off or land management is being done well are studied, it becomes evident that their Party workers, including the chief secretaries of their Party committees, are working hard. With a high sense of responsibility, Party workers, having walked ten steps, should run a hundred, even a thousand steps. They may miss their sleep and meals while working for the benefit of the people, but they should find pleasure and pride in doing so. Party workers should have the ability to take action, the ability to carry out a project, once started, without giving up halfway in the face of difficulties. What they think and study is to no avail if it is not translated into reality. What we need are officials with the ability to take action, not spout empty words. A man who supports the Party with practical deeds is truly faithful. All Party workers should be well aware of the Party’s intention that they should become officials of the Kim Chaek type, men of practical ability equipped with a thoroughgoing outlook on the leader. In the future, we are going to assess officials, with their work results as a criterion. Officials who are in charge of personnel administration and guidance to Party life should also observe the principle of assessing cadres, with the deeds they have performed for the Party and the leader, for the motherland and the people, as a criterion. There are officials who, out of fear of being called to account, work as far as they think fit or, without any enthusiasm for their work, maintain the status quo, or keep to their posts by currying favour with others. There are even officials who get along each day noncommittally, saying that it would be better to do just as they are told, because they may make mistakes by working creatively. All Party workers should not only demonstrate devotion to their work by redoubling their efforts, but establish a revolutionary habit of sharing board with the people and setting personal examples for them. President Kim Il Sung said that during the anti-Japanese armed struggle, the commanding personnel ate from the same woks with the  240 rank and file, and shared life and death with them, forming an integral whole with them; in this way they could defeat the Japanese imperialists and achieve the liberation of the country. Learning from the President’s method of work, Party officials should share board with the masses and lead them by personal example. When they visit their subordinate units, they should not stay only in their Party secretaries’ offices, but go to the work places, houses and dormitories where the masses work and live, to acquaint themselves with the actual situation and adopt appropriate measures. When a difficult and hard task is given, they should not be afraid of self-sacrifice, but be the first to throw themselves into the task and stand in the vanguard in carrying it out. If they shout the slogan “Follow me!” and lead the people from the vanguard as the commanding officers of the People’s Army did during the construction of the Anbyon Youth Power Station, they will be able to pull down any barriers and even move mountains. We should further intensify the education of young people. As successors to the revolution, young people will shoulder the country’s future. Only when we intensify their education and train them to be reliable reserves of the Party and successors to the revolution can the country prosper and the revolution win victory after victory. We should educate and train them well so as to ensure that they always make breakthroughs in the vanguard of socialist construction and national defence. We should ensure that all young people learn the spirit cherished by our soldiers of defending unto death the leadership of the revolution and the high ideological and spiritual outlook of the students at Mangyongdae Revolutionary School, who are steadily carrying forward the lineage of the revolution. The ideological and spiritual outlook of our soldiers and the students at Mangyongdae Revolutionary School is very high. I gain strength and courage from their ideological and spiritual outlook. Whenever I meet young soldiers, I feel they are fully determined to defend the leadership of the revolution, even at the risk of their lives.  241 Of course, the civilian youth, including the students, have a revolutionary character, but theirs is not as high as that of the soldiers and the students at Mangyongdae Revolutionary School. We should strengthen the education of young people so as to raise their ideological and spiritual state to the level of that of our young soldiers. The entire Party and society should pay attention to the education of the younger generation. In particular, the youth league should act responsibly in performing its duty as an ideological educational organization. The youth league should organize the education of the younger generation more scrupulously in keeping with the requirements of the Party and the present situation, so as to ensure that they, with pure, unstained loyalty, always advance in the vanguard through fire and water in response to the Party’s call. They should be educated so that they remain faithful to the oath they made at the Eighth Congress of the League of Socialist Working Youth and the Conference of the League of Socialist Working Youth. The youth league should educate the younger generation in the spirit of defending the leader unto death, the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and the spirit of revolutionary optimism, which the first and second generations of the revolution cherished, so that they defend our socialism to the end. For the revolutionary cause of Juche to be implemented with success, the youth league must be strong. I always express my trust in the youth league, calling it a reserve combat unit and task force of the Supreme Commander and saying that if the younger generation numbering eight million are trained as human bombs and bullets to defend the Party and the leader unto death, there will be nothing we are afraid of in this world. Officials of the central committee of the youth league should always be mindful of the trust and expectations the Party places in them, and act responsibly in performing their work. Officials of the Department of Science and Education of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea and in the  242 education sector shoulder a heavy responsibility for the education of the younger generation. They should pay close attention to the education of the younger generation, and train them to be human bombs and bullets. We should work well with scientists. It is only by working well with scientists and ensuring that they display to the full their revolutionary enthusiasm and creative wisdom with high loyalty to the Party, the country and the people so that they play their role as the people in charge of science and technology, that we can solve the various scientific and technological problems arising in developing the economy and improving the people’s standard of living. With the intention of paying closer attention to scientists from the start of this year, I sent on New Year’s Day gifts to the scientists at the State Academy of Sciences and Kim Il Sung University and many other scientists, as well as to model working people and soldiers. On receiving the gifts, the scientists were said to have been moved to tears at being granted such special favour on New Year’s Day. They expressed their determination to prove themselves worthy of the Party’s solicitude by working harder this year as faithful supporters of its leadership. Officials should understand how highly the Party values scientists and how much importance it attaches to science, and educate them well so as to remould them on a revolutionary pattern and ensure that they support the Party with their creative wisdom and scientific and technological successes. To work effectively with scientists, Party workers should go deep among them, and pay close attention to their living conditions, however difficult the country’s economic situation is. It would be advisable for them to pay frequent visits to units where large numbers of scientists work, and universities where reserve scientists are trained. President Kim Il Sung said that senior officials of the Party Central Committee and of provincial, city, and county Party committees should frequently visit universities. They should go among the scientists at universities and research institutes, learn about  243 their working and living conditions and lead them to perform their duties properly with a firm belief in victory. Party workers, if they are to work with scientists, should improve their own qualifications. They are currently reluctant to go to universities because of their own low level of qualifications. They should be men of versatile talents: if they go among scientists, they should work expertly with them as appropriate to the latter’s level, and if they go among young people, they should work effectively with them as appropriate to the latter’s characteristics. But this is not happening now. Party workers should possess advanced, multifaceted knowledge appropriate for a university graduate. They should know how to play the piano, dance, sing, make speeches and write articles. We should build up the ranks of Party workers with able men who are well-rounded, and make sure that they work strenuously to raise their level and improve their practical abilities. We should continue to channel efforts into strengthening the People’s Army. If we are to defend socialism and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche with success, the People’s Army must be strong. It is only when the army is strong that the enemy will not dare attack our country. It is because the People’s Army, the revolutionary armed forces of our Party, is strong that we are now able to frustrate the enemy’s anti-DPRK, anti-socialist schemes. The enemy fear our army. Commenting on my field inspections of numerous units of the KPA on the frontline and in the rear last year, the enemy say that they were deliberate and planned and that it seemed north Korea had finished its preparations for a possible war. They are particularly nervous about my visit to Panmunjom and meeting with the soldiers there. That socialism collapsed in some countries without a shot being fired was related to the fact that their armed forces had not been built up and strengthened. This lesson shows that strengthening the army is key to the destiny of socialism. Although socialism crumbled in some countries, it is winning  244 victory after victory in our country in the face of the raging winds, because we have a powerful army. In our country’s situation, in which we are building socialism under siege and in the face of ceaseless military threats from the imperialists, the people, the socialist state and the Party cannot maintain their existence if they are not supported by a strong army. In this sense, we can say that the army is the people, the state and the Party. Since strengthening the army is an important issue which is linked to the destiny of the country and the revolution, President Kim Il Sung, under the difficult conditions created immediately after the country’s liberation, established the regular revolutionary army of the Party with fighters trained in the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle as its backbone and put every effort into strengthening and developing it. When I was looking round the revolutionary museum at Kang Kon Military Academy during a visit the other day, I was moved to see photographs showing the great efforts he made to build a regular revolutionary army immediately after liberation. Among them was a photograph of my parents and me at the graduation ceremony of the second term of the First Central Military Academy on October 14, 1948. My mother has her head bowed in the photograph, because she was shedding tears. At that time I asked her why. She answered that it was because the stalwart officer cadets reminded her of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and the comrades who had fallen in action. Her affection for her comrades in the revolution was truly great. Her sincere affection and warm human feelings for her revolutionary comrades were her inborn nature. She was very fond of the students at Mangyongdae Revolutionary School, and visited the Pyongyang Institute and military academies frequently, devoting herself heart and soul to strengthening the revolutionary armed forces. She was a truly outstanding person who enjoyed the unanimous respect of her revolutionary comrades. The exploits she performed in the history of army building are truly great. We should further build up the People’s Army as an army of our own style, an army of the Party. We should direct unremitting efforts  245 to strengthening the army, to prepare all the soldiers as matchless combatants who are prepared to defend the leader and the Party at all costs. Officials, being fully aware that our destiny rests on the People’s Army, should be active in strengthening and supporting it. Economic work should also relate to strengthening the army. Civilians should be more active in assisting the army. The people are assisting the soldiers with all sincerity, just as they do their own sons and daughters, despite the difficult conditions, and the soldiers find great encouragement in this. In the course of the people actively assisting the soldiers, the relationship between them is getting closer; the people should assist the soldiers ever more vigorously. When supporting the soldiers, some units and officials visit only the People’s Army units which I inspected, and this is a mistake. Since I have already solved the problems in the lives of the soldiers in those units, supporting such units is pointless. If officials and units in society are keen to help the soldiers whole-heartedly, they should go to units which I have yet to visit, to encourage and help them. We should look after Mangyongdae Revolutionary School with deep care. The school is a base for training reserve cadres for our revolutionary armed forces, which has inherited brilliant revolutionary traditions. Building up the school and helping it was the wish of President Kim Il Sung, who valued the future generation of the revolution and devoted his all to ensuring that they stoutly succeeded to the bloodline of Juche. In the arduous days when he was advancing to the area of Mt Paektu to bring about a new great upsurge in the Korean revolution during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, he first met the members of the Children’s Corps in Maanshan, and lavished his affection on them. There can be no one who does not know the anecdote of how he gave his only blanket to a sick child. The members of the Children’s Corps, who grew up under his warm care from the days of Maanshan, played a significant role in founding the Party, the state and the army after the liberation. He had Mangyongdae Revolutionary School built after the  246 liberation of the country, and visited it frequently, looking after its students as he had done the members of the Children’s Corps in Maanshan. The love he devoted to bringing up the reserves who would carry forward the bloodline of Juche, was infinite. Recalling his noble intention, I visited Mangyongdae Revolutionary School today, the first day of this year. I had been trying to go there for a long time, but I had to postpone my visits as I was too busy. When I went there today, the students were so happy that they burst into tears, calling me father. I saw an art performance staged by them. Not only was the programme excellent, but also their tearful determination was impressive. They expressed their resolve to carry forward the revolution stoutly, cherishing the noble sense of obligation of President Kim Il Sung who had a revolutionary school built at Mangyongdae immediately after liberation for the sons and daughters of his comrades who had fallen in action in the fight for the liberation of the country, as well as the love my mother lavished on the students at the school. They promised to prove themselves worthy of the Party’s solicitude by training and studying harder and preparing themselves as reserve cadres for the revolutionary armed forces. The student who introduced today’s performance, recited a poem and sang a song very well; he has a good voice, and looks handsome. I heard that his father was serving in the navy when he died, and that he lost his mother later. I am going to make sure that he grows up well as a son of our Party. The students at Mangyongdae Revolutionary School also performed a good martial arts demonstration. The ideological and spiritual state of the students at the school, who are carrying forward the bloodline of Juche, is quite remarkable. Seeing them, I was convinced that the brilliant revolutionary traditions of our Party created by President Kim Il Sung are being carried forward stoutly, and that a reliable backbone for our revolutionary armed forces is being trained. Because the People’s Army has such a reliable cadre-training base for the revolution as Mangyongdae Revolutionary  247 School, its prospects are bright, and it will be ever victorious. From the point of view of ensuring the purity of the revolution from generation to generation, it was good that I visited the school on the morning of the first day of the new year. We should build up Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and train its students well. Since they are the successors to the revolution who will become its backbone, the Party should take charge of training them. The school should be equipped with computers and all other modern apparatuses it needs for experiments and practical training in the natural sciences, such as physics and chemistry, and the level of education and instruction should be raised so as to produce outstanding talents for the armed forces, just as Pyongyang Senior Middle School No. 1 is doing for society. The students at the school should be provided with adequate living conditions. As I said before, the Mangyongdae District Party Committee and the Mangyongdae branch farm of the State Farm of Mangyongdae District should take full responsibility for supplying the school’s students. The Mangyongdae branch farm should be turned into a farm serving the school. Senior officials of the Party Central Committee and cadres of the army should visit the school frequently, and take care of the living conditions of its students. President Kim Il Sung went to Maanshan to see the members of the Children’s Corps in the most trying period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. It is wrong for our cadres not to have shown concern for the students at the school nor thought of visiting them. This shows that they are only paying lip service to upholding the President’s revolutionary cause. In the future senior officials, including secretaries of the Party Central Committee, must frequently visit the school and look after the study and living conditions of its students. Army corps commanders should also visit the school whenever they come to Pyongyang. I am going to have a military parade held in the plaza in front of the Kumsusan Memorial Palace on April 15 this year, to commemorate the 85th anniversary of President Kim Il Sung’s birth.  248 A military parade to be held there where he lies in state will be more significant than one held in Kim Il Sung Square. For a military parade to be held in the plaza in front of the Kumsusan Memorial Palace, a bridge should be built for it to pass over and the road to the palace expanded. These projects should be undertaken by the army and finished before the end of March. The Administration Council should supply the raw and other materials needed so that the projects can be carried out without a hitch. Although we are now on the Arduous March, our revolution has a bright future, and its victory is assured. Compared to the days when our revolution and construction started from scratch, the difficulties we are experiencing today are nothing. As the song goes, our Party started everything from scratch and has brought about epoch-making changes until now. President Kim Il Sung launched the great anti-Japanese war for the liberation of the country with nothing, and gained a brilliant victory; he began to build a new country from scratch after its liberation; he also started reconstruction on the debris and ashes after the Korean war and finished it in a short period of time, turning our country into a socialist industrial state. Starting everything with nothing but bare hands and winning great victories is a glorious tradition of our Party and revolution. Whenever I hear the song We Started from Scratch sung by the Merited Chorus of the Korean People’s Army Song and Dance Ensemble, I feel very emotional. The lyrics of the song are excellent. The song should be given wide publicity, on the radio for example. We should bring home to the people, the young people in particular, the glorious traditions of our revolution and construction, which started from scratch and have achieved great victories, so that they live in that spirit and bring the Arduous March to a successful conclusion. With pride in the traditions of the revolution and construction, we should turn out this year under the leadership of the Party, to open a new, historic chapter in its annals. I am confident that everything will go smoothly this year. I went to the Kumsusan Memorial Palace at midnight last night with leading  249 cadres of the Party and the government to pay homage to President Kim Il Sung. I felt as if he was smiling at us, and encouraging us; apparently he knew we were experiencing difficulties. I felt a lump in my throat. I felt he was still taking care of us, just as he had done in his lifetime. The new year has started with good signs. This morning in Pyongyang it rained out of season, and then snowed; in the afternoon there was a blizzard. I have never seen such a blizzard before in Pyongyang. I call it the “blizzard of Mangyongdae,” which gives us all faith in victory and portends a proud victory. Seeing the snow and blizzard at the very beginning of this year, the people are also pleased; they say that farming will be good this year. We should all advance vigorously for the ultimate victory of our revolution with confidence and optimism.",today greet new pride having firmly defend socialism arduous struggle ring new mark third

17.03.1997,Kim Jong Il,"All sectors and units should emulate the revolutionary soldier spirit. The revolutionary soldier spirit is a fighting spirit that officials, Party members and other working people should all emulate, and a source of ideological and spiritual strength which will enable them to advance victoriously by overcoming today’s difficulties. If they give full play to this spirit there will be nothing for them to fear, whatever the difficulties and hardships that may crop up on the road ahead, and they will be able to develop the revolution and construction without letup. This is why I stress the importance of officials, Party members and other working people emulating the revolutionary soldier spirit. The Korean People’s Army, formed of the sons and daughters of the workers, cooperative farmers and working intellectuals, has assumed the noble mission of defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country and the dignity and honour of the nation. It is the main force of the revolution and a buttress of the country. We are now holding talks and dialogue with the enemy on equal terms and with dignity, because the People’s Army is strong. It is also because the People’s Army is strong that we are holding the  268 initiative in the confrontation with the enemy, while defending the sovereignty of the country and the interests of the people. Looking back on the historical course of our revolution, we see that the army has always played an important role. Most other countries founded the party first and then the army. This was the case with the Soviet Union. But President Kim Il Sung, with a scientific insight into the requirements of our developing revolution, founded the revolutionary army first, liberated the country by driving out the Japanese imperialist aggressors by force of arms, and then founded the Party. Because of this, the urgent requirements of our developing revolution could be fully addressed and the Party could be founded in a short period of time as a party with solid ideological and organizational foundations and a mass basis, and developed into a political and leading force of the revolution. That the history of our people’s revolutionary struggle is unique, in which the army was founded first and the revolution and construction have developed based on it and complete independence has been maintained in the whole course of army building and revolutionary struggle, is being demonstrated with the help of concrete examples, even in the foreign media. In the days of harsh trials, like those we are experiencing today, it is only when the army is strong and the revolutionary soldier spirit displayed in the army is emulated, that we can defend the dignity of the country and the socialist system against the schemes of the enemy to isolate and stifle us, and can we advance the revolution and construction true to President Kim Il Sung’s wish. However, a number of officials are only paying lip service to emulating the revolutionary soldier spirit, while failing to conduct effective organizational work for applying it. There are no separate, special occasions for emulating the revolutionary soldier spirit. One can learn from the ideological and spiritual world that is evident in the practical struggle and life of the soldiers, and then apply it in one’s work and life; that is all. We should see to it that officials and working people learn from the  269 revolutionary soldier spirit while witnessing the struggle of the soldiers who are working at the construction site of the Anbyon Youth Power Station and on other back-breaking and labour-consuming projects, or while enjoying artistic performances staged by soldiers. Every item in the programme of the Itinerant Youth Art Squad of the Korean People’s Army and the art squads of individual army units vibrates with the revolutionary soldier spirit and is high in ideological quality, moving audiences and inspiring them to heroic feats. The artistic performances staged by soldiers should be shown to officials and working people so that they can learn from the revolutionary soldier spirit. Workers in the munitions industry should be encouraged to stand in the vanguard of the effort to emulate the revolutionary soldier spirit. The Party’s information and motivational work should be done in conformity with the actual situation. Today’s period of the Arduous March is different from previous eras, so the content and methods of doing information and motivational work should be changed. If this work is conducted by telling people that they should overcome difficulties, as it was in the past, it cannot resonate in their hearts. Today’s situation is different from what it was in the 1960s and 1970s. Information and motivational work should be done as it was done on the front line, as required by the actual situation and circumstances. It is necessary to inform people of the historical course our revolution has travelled. The external environment for our revolution in the 1960s and 1970s was quite different from what it is now. In those days there existed a number of socialist countries, and several countries helped us to a considerable extent. Economic transactions between the socialist countries were conducted in a socialist manner, so everything was favourable for us. The present external environment for our revolution is totally different from what it was in those days. Since the socialist market has imploded, we must buy everything in foreign currency. Without  270 foreign currency, we cannot buy even one kilogramme of oil or cotton. To make matters worse, our country has experienced unprecedented natural calamities for the past three or four years consecutively. This is why those who are familiar with the situation in our country, and even the Americans, say that it is a miracle that we are defending socialism and playing the role of a fortress of socialism. We should give Party members and other working people a good understanding of the historical course of our revolution, so that they can overcome the difficulties and hardships with an indomitable spirit and revolutionary optimism, breathing the same air as the Party. The revolutionary soldier spirit springs from a revolutionary faith and will. In order to induce Party members and other working people to emulate the revolutionary soldier spirit, we should further intensify education in the revolutionary faith and will among them. Our present circumstances are strained, and may grow more strained in the future. However, we must never yield to the difficulties. The enemy claims that we might “collapse,” but they are deluding themselves. We must bring the Arduous March to a successful conclusion and make a continuous advance at all costs by holding high the red flag associated with President Kim Il Sung’s life. If one is strong in faith and will, one is capable of overcoming every manner of difficulty and trial. The anti-Japanese guerrillas, though they had no support or backing from a state, overcame manifold difficulties and hardships, and liberated the country with a strong will, because they were convinced of the righteousness of their revolutionary cause and its victory. The situation in the days of postwar reconstruction was also difficult, but our people were not in the least daunted. The Arduous March we are conducting today can be called a war without gunshots, a war of wills. Only people who are strong in the revolutionary faith and will can be the victors in this war. We must make a breakthrough in this war at all costs with a strong will, and emerge victorious. We must be resolved to continue to wage the  271 revolution to the last, even though difficulties of the sort the anti-Japanese guerrillas experienced may crop up, and we must equip Party members and other working people with this spirit. We must bring the Arduous March to a successful conclusion this year by all means, and from next year raise the people’s standard of living. Ensuring that the people live well and in happiness is the highest principle guiding the activities of our Party. Officials must study ways of bringing the present Arduous March to a successful conclusion and make all the people, including the workers and farmers, live well and in happiness, and conduct corresponding political work. All officials should be well aware of the Party’s intentions, and bring about greater results in the performance of their revolutionary tasks by displaying a high sense of responsibility. We should exert every effort to develop science and technology, and thus overtake and outstrip other countries in this regard. We should work miracles in raising our science and technology to the highest world standard. We should not be tight-fisted in developing science and technology. If anything is needed for developing computer technology, it must be presented for approval.",sector unit emulate revolutionary soldier spirit revolutionary soldier spirit fight spirit official party

10.09.1997,Kim Jong Il,"The crops are promising this year. Although we have suffered a considerable loss caused by abnormal high temperatures, drought and tidal waves this year, the crops are not bad. It is wonderful that we are able to harvest good crops by farming strenuously in very difficult circumstances. That the crops are good is thanks to the help rendered by the People’s Army. In fact, this year’s farming has been done by the People’s Army in the main. But for them, this year’s farming would have been ruined. The soldiers did a lot of work. Where soldiers helped farmers in their work in the rural communities, the relationship between them improved; this is a great success. The important thing now is to gather the crops by harvesting them with care so as not to waste even a single grain. The crops the soldiers and farmers have cultivated by the sweat of their brows must not be wasted. Crops produced as part of the collective economy should be threshed and stored in granaries without wasting a single grain. Starting now, all efforts should be mobilized for harvesting. For grain production to be increased in our country, where arable land is limited, double-cropping is decisive. It is my intention to have double-cropping conducted on a large scale. The west coast areas,  332 particularly the areas south of Jongju, should undertake double-cropping. As many areas gained experience in double-cropping this year, it should be popularized next year. To boost the production of grains, all idle land should be identified and planted with crops. The grains produced from idle land and beans produced from ridges between plots should be distributed to their producers. Such crops should not be procured by the state. I have been told that cooperative farm management boards and workteams are having these crops procured on some excuse or other; they are wrong to do so. I have already instructed that farmers should be allowed to grow beans on the ridges of paddy and non-paddy fields for their own consumption. The farmers are quite delighted about this and have been enthusiastic about cultivating beans on ridges. But because what they grew has been procured by the state in recent years, their enthusiasm has gradually waned and they are not willing to cultivate beans on ridges. It is a good system, but it is being dismantled; this is wrong. How good it would be if we could sample soybean paste and sauce made with beans the farmers gathered from the ridges on our visit to the rural areas! A promise made by the state to the farmers must not be broken. Discouraging farmers from growing grain on ridges or idle plots is tantamount to divorcing the masses from the Party. It must be made a rule that farmers take 100 per cent of the grain they harvest from ridges or idle plots. It must be ensured that the beans farmers have cultivated on ridges and the grain in idle plots are all given to their cultivators, true to the measure adopted by the Party. Farmers will identify every idle plot and plant grains with enthusiasm only when they are allowed to consume such grain which they have cultivated individually while participating in collective labour earnestly. The grain from fields that have been reclaimed for the production of raw materials should be used by commercial and public catering networks. This will help hotels, restaurants and noodle houses to operate on a regular basis.  333 We should gather a good harvest next year, too, but the problem is that there is not much water in the reservoirs. Reservoirs cannot be filled only with melted snow water. Measures should be taken from now on to fill the reservoirs with water. For the socialist economy to be managed properly, political and moral incentives should be given precedence, supported by material incentives. Material incentives should not be neglected on the plea that political and moral incentives should be stressed. Giving one-sided emphasis to material incentives and neglecting them are both wrong. Edification alone is not enough. While strengthening ideological edification among farmers to motivate them to farm with high production zeal, we should heighten their material interests, so as to ensure that they do not leave even an inch of land idle. At present, state-owned farms are not proving their worth; measures must be taken to solve this problem. In the present situation, state-owned farms, with the exception of some large and mechanized farms like the Taehongdan County Combined Farm, are failing to display their viability. They can operate properly only when they are supplied with enough oil, tractors and other farm machinery. Renaming the cooperative farms state-owned farms is not a solution to the problem. The Administration Council and the Ministry of Food Administration should take measures promptly to normalize food supplies. It is important that the more difficult the food situation is, the more efficiently food administration should be conducted. The point is to supply food to the people on a regular basis; then, other problems can be solved gradually. If not, we can neither shore up the economy nor stamp out non-socialist practices. It is wonderful that Jagang Province has built so many small- and medium-sized power stations. As our country has many rivers, we should build small- and medium-sized power stations in large numbers as well as large ones, to ease the strain on power supply. In the present situation, we should build many small- and medium-sized power stations.  334 The example of Jagang Province should be popularized throughout the country. Party and economic officials in the capital and the provinces have looked around the power stations built in Jagang Province, and their impressions are very positive. We should ensure that small- and medium-sized power stations are built on a large scale in the provinces by drawing on the experience of Jagang Province. The organs of the armed forces, including the People’s Army, should visit Jagang Province and study its experience in building power station. Owing to the strain on the electricity supply, people in Pyongyang are going cold in winter. Something must be done about this. If heat is not supplied properly this winter again, it will be hard for them. We should see to it that this does not happen this year by taking measures in advance. We should see to it that they wage an active drive to economize on electricity. In order to shore up the economy, we should combine the effective use of the existing economic foundations with the building of new factories that can support economic development. The commissions and ministries of the Administration Council should effectively repair and reinforce the existing factories and enterprises and put their production on a normal footing. The People’s Army should undertake many new construction projects, as it has done in the past. We should make a revolution in building pavements. At present, the general state of roads in our country is not good, particularly the pavements. The pavements in both Pyongyang and the provinces are not good. It is unacceptable that the pavements used by people are not good in our people-centred society, where the people are valued most. With a determination to bring about a change in building pavements, I ordered that equipment should be imported for a paving-brick factory. After it is imported, good bricks should be manufactured and laid on the pavements. The paving bricks should be made with high-intensity cement of over 400; only then will they be clean on the surface and last long. The floor of the Mujigae Tunnel  335 now under repair should be paved with high-intensity cement; then it will not become bumpy. High-intensity cement is needed in large amounts for building other tunnels. In the future, rail sleepers must also be made with high-intensity cement. As high-intensity cement is required in large amounts, the Sangwon Cement Complex should produce significant quantities of cement of over 400 intensity. The Mujigae Tunnel repair project requires almost 10 000 tons of high-intensity cement and we need a large number of paving bricks; so the Sangwon Cement Complex should produce tens of thousands of tons of high-intensity cement. The production of high-intensity cement requires high-calorific coal; this type of coal is mined at the Pongchang Coal Mine. The Pongchang Coal Mine should take responsibility for supplying the anthracite that is needed in producing high-intensity cement, and the Ministry of Railways for transporting it. The Ministry of Railways should provide the Pongchang Coal Mine with locomotives and wagons for carrying coal from the mine to the Sangwon Cement Complex. If the Ministry of Railways transported anthracite and scrap iron from the Pongchang Coal Mine to the Sangwon Cement Complex and February Steel Works, the latter enterprises would claim to be able to supply the cement and high-tensile wire required for producing concrete sleepers; this should be allowed. The impressions of people who have travelled by train recently are not good because the trains jolt over bad railways; something should be done about this. It has been reported to me that guidance to the Party organizations in the Ministry of Railways is not unified; this should be studied and necessary measures taken. All sectors and units should manage the economy of the country more methodically and wage an economy drive. State banquets should also be simple. Today I visited Kim Il Sung Military University. The President’s bronze statue should be replaced with a new one. The present statue was erected in 1970. The President’s statue at Kim Il Sung  336 University of Politics is a fine one since it depicts him in his generalissimo’s uniform, but his statue at Kim Il Sung Military University is not so good. The President’s statue to be erected at Kim Il Sung Military University should be a better depiction. We should hold him in high esteem for all time. It is good that Kim Jong Suk Naval University set about erecting a bronze statue of Kim Jong Suk and repairing its buildings as I instructed the other day on my visit there. The walls of the main building in front of which the statue is going to be erected should be pebble-dashed with white cement, and the buildings around it should be painted white like the buildings in Kwangbok Street. The Capital City Construction Headquarters should provide the university with white cement and cladding materials, and send building specialists to help the repair of its buildings.",crop promise

16.01.1998,Kim Jong Il,"In recent years Jagang Province has achieved a lot in the difficult conditions of the Arduous March. In true response to the Party’s policy, the province has built many small- and medium-sized power stations by its own efforts in conformity with the regional features, built up its factories and enterprises in a hygienic and cultured way and equipped them with modern machinery. It has done land management well, its towns are clean, and the ideological and spiritual state of the local people is very good. Wherever I go, I can see that the local people are bright, cheerful and optimistic. This is a manifestation of the way people in Jagang Province live and work; they are living and working with a firm conviction in socialism. I feel very satisfied with the results of the work of the officials, Party members and other working people in Jagang Province. While looking around Jagang Province, I have been convinced once again that what I planned and put forward–the lines and policies of our Party–are right. The officials, Party members and other  364 working people of Jagang Province have shown, through their practical example, how one should support the Party in such difficult days as today. The people of Jagang Province are giving full play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. They are so strong-willed that they seem never to get pessimistic. Workers in Jagang Province are said to have worked during the Arduous March with a determination that they must never allow their machines to stop running and that they must not forsake their machines until they die of hunger. How praiseworthy they are! The revolutionary conviction and will of the people of Jagang Province are reflected in the slogans emblazoned along the streets and in the factory compounds. “Let us go the thorny path cheerfully!”–that is a very good slogan. The workers I talked with asked for more work, not food or similar things. To see them working and living vigorously and optimistically without any complaint, I felt delighted and refreshed as if I was listening to the songs sung by the Merited Chorus of the Korean People’s Army. Sleighs and people carrying manure for the fields were streaming to the farms, and they were in high spirits. The idea that when the Party is determined, they can do anything is brimming over in the minds of the people of Jagang Province. Whenever they saw my car passing by, they would run towards it cheering and shedding tears. This feeling cannot be manufactured or bought with money. It is a phenomenon that can be witnessed only in our country, where the Party and the people are united single-heartedly. In the period of the Arduous March, the people of Jagang Province have experienced great difficulties owing to the food scarcity; this was attributable to the US imperialists. They are resorting to every conceivable scheme to stifle us. They are not only bringing political pressure and military threats to bear on us but also imposing economic sanctions. This is why our Party and people have had to undergo the Arduous March and suffer such hardships. You say that  365 the Jagang people are determined to take revenge on the enemy thousands of times, so indignant are they at the US schemes; their ideological and spiritual preparedness is good. The Jagang Provincial Party Committee has conducted effective ideological education among the local people. It should rouse them more dynamically to show the whole world that Korea is rising like a phoenix from the ashes. Seeing the Jagang people filled with the spirit of self-reliance and the spirit of loyalty, the spirit of single-hearted unity to share life and death with the Party, I have felt greatly encouraged and convinced that socialism has struck root in their hearts. Victory is surely in store for us as long as we have such a working class and people. So long as we have them to support us, I do not doubt that we will emerge as the victor in a showdown with the US imperialists, and I feel as if I could move the Earth. The Jagang people say that their political and ideological state is sound because President Kim Il Sung trained them hard and the Party has had great trust in and expectations of them; frankly speaking, President Kim Il Sung’s trust in and expectations of the workers and other people of Jagang Province were extraordinary, and I, too, have complete trust in them. The province has many modern machine factories, a priceless asset bequeathed to us by President Kim Il Sung. When the war was at its height, he had them built in Jagang. We must add glory to the imperishable achievements he made in Jagang with such great efforts. There are many workers engaged in the machine-building industry in Jagang Province, and they can overcome any difficulties and carry out any tasks once they are motivated. This is why I am determined to bring about a fresh turn in socialist economic construction by creating an example in the province and popularizing it across the country, and am giving on-site guidance here ahead of other provinces. If we are to make our country, our motherland, prosperous by bringing about a fresh upsurge in the revolution and construction, we must bring the working class, the core force of society and vanguard  366 of socialist construction, to awareness before anybody else, and ignite their enthusiasm. Ours is a society of the workers, and a country of the workers. There is nothing we cannot do if we educate the workers in a revolutionary way and rally them. I have inspected many factories since the beginning of this year in order to ignite the enthusiasm of our workers and encourage them to advance in the vanguard of the revolutionary upsurge. President Kim Il Sung went to the Kangson Steel Plant after the war, met the workers there, and roused them to launch the Chollima movement. Today, when we are on a forced march, I intend to make a breakthrough in the forced march by creating an example in Jagang Province. Everything is going smoothly in Jagang Province, and its prospects are bright. Now the local people can be said to be on a hope-filled march, march to paradise. We should ensure that a movement is launched to follow the example of Jagang Province so that the whole country learns from the Kanggye spirit, the revolutionary spirit of the Jagang people. The Kanggye spirit represents the spirit of our people, who are on a forced march to final victory. If we fight in this spirit, we will emerge as victors in this grandiose struggle. We are building socialism in as difficult a situation as that of the postwar days. In a certain sense, the present situation can be said to be worse than that immediately after the war. Though we started postwar reconstruction from the ashes, we received help from the socialist countries. But now we are undertaking the revolution and construction, experiencing unprecedented trials and difficulties, in the situation in which the socialist countries have collapsed. Though we are experiencing temporary difficulties today, we will be able to build a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country in the near future. The enemy, seeing that our people are advancing by breaking through the difficulties with revolutionary faith and an unbending will, united around the Party, is afraid that we will soon build such a country. When the officials in every sector and at every unit pull their weight and work boldly as those in Jagang Province are doing now,  367 we are sure to bring about a turn in economic work and the people’s standard of living. We must always advance in the face of the trials and difficulties, full of confidence in victory. He who laughs last laughs longest. When we see who laughs last, it will surely be us, the victors–this is the belief and will of our Party. We must charge forward towards final victory full of confidence and optimism. We should ensure that just as the workers of the Kangson Steel Plant did in the trying days after the war, Jagang Province holds high the torch of a new revolutionary upsurge today, standing in the vanguard, and the whole country follows it on the socialist forced march to emerge victorious. We should build small- and medium-sized power stations on a wide scale and thus step up the electrification of the whole country. In our country’s situation, building small- and medium-sized hydroelectric power stations in large numbers is practical. We are more familiar with the small- and medium-sized power stations that generate electricity by using hydraulic power, not wind power, and such stations are more feasible. If they are built in various areas, it will be possible to undertake fish culture and they will add beauty to the scenery. It will also be conducive to land management. This means that several things will be gained by building them. If the provinces build many small- and medium-sized power stations, they can manage their local economy by their own efforts. Visiting the houses in Jagang Province which are supplied with electricity generated by such power stations, I felt as if I was in another world; how convenient and cultured the life of the local people is, living in rooms heated with electricity and eating food cooked on electricity! By electrification, I mean enabling people to live in electrically-heated houses eating food cooked on electricity and using TV sets, refrigerators and all other electric household appliances, like in Jagang Province. The rural villages in Jagang Province which have been electrified can be called ideal communist villages. The Jagang people have done a lot, like building small- and medium-sized power stations, and they are now enjoying the rewards.  368 I had TV sets provided to the electrified villages in Jagang Province. In the future the units, which have realized electrification by building small- and medium-sized power stations as Jagang Province did, should be provided with TV sets, electric cookers and other electric household appliances on a preferential basis, to make use of them to their heart’s content. Building small- and medium-sized power stations in large numbers is not a task the Party has put forward only recently. President Kim Il Sung said on several occasions long ago that we should build many small- and medium-sized power stations to ease the strain on the supply of electricity and step up the electrification of the whole country. But because officials failed to try to implement his instructions to the letter, the electricity situation has become more strained. Had we started ten years ago to build small- and medium-sized power stations on a large scale, we would not have experienced the serious problem of today. It is necessary to organize the studying of the reports and resolutions from the Fifth and Sixth Party congresses. These documents clarify all the problems arising in socialist construction, such as building small- and medium-sized power stations on a large scale and providing bus services in the rural areas. However, officials have paid no attention to building small- and medium-sized power stations. The report to the Fifth Party Congress and President Kim Il Sung’s other works, as well as the Party’s literature, clarify everything, so there is no need to study anything else. We should study in depth the reports and resolutions from the Fifth and Sixth Party congresses, identify those things we have failed to implement, and launch a Party-wide drive to implement them to the letter. From now on, major publicity should be given to building small- and medium-sized power stations so as to realize the electrification of the whole country. Jagang Province should continue to stand in the vanguard in building small- and medium-sized power stations. Small- and medium-sized power stations should be built in various forms and by various methods in conformity with local features. The  369 floating-style power station built on the Puk River in Kanggye is excellent. Small- and medium-sized power stations can be built anywhere water flows, be it a mountainous area or a plain. It will be advisable to build such power stations in tiers along rivers; then plenty of electricity can be produced. The electricity produced by the provinces themselves should not be transmitted into the national power grid; the provinces should be allowed to use it for their local economy. If such electricity is transmitted into the national power grid, the provinces will not try to produce electricity by themselves. The electricity produced by provincial small- and medium-sized power stations should be allowed for the use of the provinces themselves, so that they can appreciate the benefits of self-reliance. We should attach importance to the munitions industry, and continue to direct a major effort to it. In the present situation we need bullets more than sweets. We can live without eating sweets, but we cannot defend socialism or maintain our existence without bullets. Whatever others may say, we must strengthen the defence capabilities of our country by continuing to direct a major effort to developing the munitions industry. We should enlist the potential of industry to the maximum and put production on a normal track. The potential of our industry is great; if we enlist it efficiently, we will be able to do anything. Even in the present difficult situation, Jagang Province is supplying by itself the necessary machinery and raw and other materials and operating major factories and enterprises by enlisting its internal reserves. The February 26 Factory is one which President Kim Il Sung, with a far-reaching plan to build an independent national economy and realize the industrialization of the country, ensured was built in the days of the Fatherland Liberation War; it has done a lot of work. The workers and technicians at this factory have produced many machines and equipment for themselves by giving full play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, so as to ensure production. The  370 factory fulfilled its plan for the first quarter of this year; it has also met its production quotas for April and May. The officials and workers at the Youth Electrics Complex have also achieved a lot under the banner of self-reliance; the scientists and technicians in particular. Having visited several factories in Jagang Province and seen them producing on a regular footing by mobilizing their own potentials and internal reserves, I feel my confidence growing. Some people are complaining about their conditions, but if we conduct an in-depth study, we can see reserves are to be found everywhere. There are more reserves to be found now than in the days of postwar reconstruction. The Namri Power Station in Songgan County was built 20 years ago with a great deal of labour, but officials left it idle without thinking how it could be operated. Now officials, Party members and other working people in Jagang Province have restored it so that it can operate at full capacity. Jagang Province has solved the problems of power and raw and other materials and put production on a normal footing by actively mobilizing its industrial potential and internal reserves; this is self-reliance. Self-reliance is best. We have experienced difficulties during the years of the Arduous March, but it was not too bad. During the Arduous March, our officials and people furthered their abilities to live by their own efforts and etched in their hearts the true meaning of self-reliance. All regions and all units should put production on a normal footing and develop the economy with the available assets by strengthening the foundations of the independent national economy and actively enlisting its potential in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, as Jagang Province did. We will never develop the economy with the money earned through tourism or by selling our resources. We would earn a certain amount of money through tourism, but it does not suit our situation. It is also a foolish idea to try to introduce foreign capital as a way of rehabilitating the economy. Even in such arduous days as those of postwar reconstruction, we did not know what tourism and foreign  371 capital were. We must never look to others. Whatever the circumstances, we must develop the economy in our own way and improve the people’s standard of living by relying on our own economic foundations. We must trust our own strength, develop the economy by our own efforts and effect an upsurge in production by making effective use of the existing economic potential. While inspecting Jagang Province, I have been convinced that if things are done as they are in Jagang Province, we will be able to shore up the country’s economy and develop it rapidly. All officials, Party members and other working people should acquire the stand of relying on our own economic foundations, and a campaign should be launched across the country to enlist to the full the potential of our industry and tap our internal reserves. In shoring up the country’s economy, we should direct our efforts to the major sectors, and put production on a regular footing in one sector after another. We should not attempt to shore up the country’s economy all at once. We should improve the economic work sector by sector in a way an ant gnaws at a bone. The Huichon General Machine Tool Factory should put its production on a normal track. Running the factory properly is of great importance in developing the country’s economy. If the factory buckles down with determination, it is fully able to put its production on a normal track. The workers at the factory have the experience of having produced 10 000 machine tools on the instruction of President Kim Il Sung; if they are motivated, putting production on a normal track will not be a problem. The relevant units of the central organs should help the factory in a responsible manner, and the Jagang Provincial Party Committee should give it effective guidance, so that it can produce the number of machine tools assigned by the Party. The quality of machine tools should be improved. Strong demand should be made to this end. Other factories and enterprises, too, should develop new technologies and set up a rigid system of inspection to improve the quality of their products. The Amnokgang Tyre Factory should put its production on a  372 normal footing. It is a factory which I am particularly concerned about and attach special importance to. Without tyres, we cannot ensure production either in agriculture or in industry. Every sector is experiencing difficulties due to the shortage of tyres. We must operate the tyre factory by enlisting the conditions and possibilities to the maximum and put its production on a regular footing. Jagang Province, since it is being given prominence by the Party for the rest of the country to follow, must put production at all its factories on a normal track. Only then can it stand in the vanguard of the forced march for final victory. If it runs the Huichon Silk Mill at full capacity, it will be able to earn a lot of foreign currency for improving the local people’s standard of living. Measures should be taken to supply cocoons to the mill so that it can operate at full capacity. Factories and enterprises should strengthen their cost control. This is a way of eliminating wasteful practices and inspiring the working people’s production zeal. We must not neglect material incentives on the plea that political and moral incentives are important. We must give precedence to political and moral incentives and at the same time combine them with material incentives in a proper proportion. I have found that factories and enterprises in Jagang Province are producing various daily necessaries separately; I think it would be a good idea for them to specialize in production. This will be conducive to improving quality. At the moment, we are not supplying sundry goods to the people in sufficient amounts; we must produce a variety of quality daily necessaries in larger amounts and supply them to the people. The work of establishing cultured ways in production and life should be conducted vigorously. I have inspected many factories and enterprises in Jagang Province, and they all look neat and tidy. Some of them even look like a rest centre or a palace. Jagang Province has spruced up Kanggye, Huichon and Manpho cities in recent years and built many houses, and the local people are keeping their houses, both inside and  373 out, in a hygienic and cultured way. The workers in Jagang Province are taking good care of the streets, villages and factories where they live and work, because they have a strong revolutionary spirit and genuinely love their workplaces and native places. They have a high determination to lay out their workplaces, their communities and their rivers and mountains in an excellent way by their own efforts. Jagang Province is exemplary in establishing cultured ways in production and life, apparently because it has so many workers who are engaged in the machine-building industry. It is natural that a new culture of the working class is being created in Jagang Province, where there are many such workers, and that it is propagated across the country. The Jagang people cherish the concepts of “my factory” and “my village”; they should give full play to this idea, and continue to spruce up their factories and villages. They should also spruce up their rural communities. Every house in the rural areas should raise domestic animals, such as chickens and rabbits, and plant fruit trees around it. Senior officials of the provincial, city and county Party committees should, with a high sense of responsibility, make continuous demands for the factories and people’s neighbourhoods to be spruced up. The revolutionary and cultured character of the Jagang people can be seen in their amateur art performances. The performances are not only sound ideologically but also simple and honest. Amateur art troupes should be more active and improve their level. They are the representatives of their respective units, like factories and enterprises. Amateur art troupes should put on performances just as their counterparts in the army do, not as professional artistes do. The main thing in their performances is the ideological character, and they should be simple and easy to understand by the masses. I showed workers in Jagang Province, who are playing the vanguard role in the forced march for final victory, a performance by the Merited Chorus of the Korean People’s Army in order to give them courage and confidence. They should regard the songs by the Merited Chorus as a march to accompany the forced march, and raise  374 their spirits by keeping step with the march in the struggle for final victory. Supply services for the working people should be improved. President Kim Il Sung said long ago that supply work is political work, and this is absolutely true. It is not only informing Party members and other working people of the Party’s policies promptly that is political work; providing efficient supply services is also political work. Effective supply services propel economic work. Factories and enterprises in Jagang Province are doing well at establishing a cultured way of working, but not at providing supply services for their employees. Only when they improve supply services for their employees and pay constant attention to sprucing up and running well their cultural and welfare establishments, such as dormitories, nurseries, kindergartens and bathhouses, can they be said to be managing their employees properly. Secretaries of factory and enterprise Party committees should draw up stage-by-stage plans, aimed at doing sideline farming well and laying out the workers’ dormitories in a cultured way. Dormitory rooms should be equipped with books for studying. Officials should visit the dormitories regularly and live with the workers, sleeping with them. Factory and enterprise dormitories should be raised to the standard of the dormitory at the Youth Electrics Complex, so that the workers enjoy good living conditions. They should also have pigs and other domestic animals raised to provide the workers with meat. I have been told that the officials of the Huichon Hotel have been extremely helpful to the scientists, technicians and skilled workers at the major factories and enterprises in Huichon during the Arduous March and contributed to their achievements by looking after them; they deserve great praise. The employees of the hotel have, by their own efforts and in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, built up a base for supply services. They have worked with the determination that, although help from superior organs is welcome, they will manage by their own efforts if such help is not available. Other  375 service organs should improve service work by learning from the example of the Huichon Hotel. We should concentrate efforts on farming so as to boost agricultural production and solve the food problem decisively. Our greatest reserve for grain production is on the plains on the west coast. We should identify reserves in the way of making the counties there that formerly produced 50 000 tons of grain each now produce 100 000 tons. In order to increase grain production, we should do double-cropping. We should not pay only lip service to double-cropping, but take practical steps, such as studying farming methods and improving seeds. Jagang Province, in view of its climatic conditions, can also do double-cropping, by planting cereal crops as the first crop and vegetables as the second. In increasing grain production, it is important to distribute crops in conformity with the regional features. Agricultural guidance organs and planning organs should not interfere with regions distributing crops in accordance with their respective regional features. As corn does not grow well in Jagang Province, it is better for it to cultivate potatoes, build a cattle farm the same as the Songam Myonggi Cattle Farm, and develop stockbreeding. Some officials in the agricultural sector forced the mountainous areas to abandon the cultivation of potatoes which grow well in such areas and grow corn instead; this had created grave consequences. Such mountainous areas as Jagang and Ryanggang provinces should plant potatoes on a large scale to improve their people’s standard of living. If mountainous areas are to do potato farming well, they should improve the potato seeds. Just as the plains improve rice and corn seeds, the mountainous areas should improve potato seeds to increase the yield. If Jagang and Ryanggang provinces plant potato seeds yielding 40 tons per hectare by improving the seeds, they will become rich. Not only potato seeds but also domestic animal breeds and fruit seeds should be improved. Nobody else should say this or that on the plea of giving guidance  376 to agriculture, because this will create confusion. I have said on several occasions that farmers know most about farming, and farmers and officials in the agricultural sector are directly responsible for farming. Party officials must never interfere in farm work or impose their opinions on farmers and officials in the agricultural sector, instead of engaging in organizational and political work, which is their duty. If farming is to be effective, manure and composite microbial fertilizer should be applied widely. Some officials in the agricultural sector ascribe the reason for the poor farming to the shortage of fertilizer and PVC sheeting; this is not a time for farming by using chemical fertilizer. It is the world trend to farm by using manure and microbial fertilizer, instead of chemical fertilizer. Applying chemical fertilizer alone is not good; it only damages the soil. What is important is to increase crop yields by using as little chemical fertilizer as possible. Manure should be produced in large amounts, and composite microbial fertilizer and biochemicals should be actively introduced. The sideline farms at organs, factories and enterprises should increase their crop yields. The area of land at such farms is large, and this means they constitute a reserve for grain production. They should decisively increase the unit-area crop yield. In order to ensure that the regions farm well, they should be appraised on the basis of their farming. However good a certain region is at land management, it should not be rated highly if it is poor at farming. Farming and land management should both be criteria for appraising the regions, but farming should be given priority. Land management should be promoted persistently. We should not rest content with the success achieved in land management in recent years; we should continue to improve rivers, build roads and plant trees. If we are to build small- and medium-sized power stations in large numbers, we should give precedence to improving rivers and streams. The northern region should not rely solely on its railways,  377 but build or improve roads for transport. In order to shore up the economy and improve the people’s standard of living, we should enhance the sense of responsibility and revolutionary spirit among officials. As President Kim Il Sung said, cadres decide everything. The work is progressing well in Jagang Province because its officials are working in a revolutionary manner. While visiting the province, I have felt more keenly the true meaning of the words of the President that cadres decide everything. Although a task may be given to officials at the same time, there is a difference in how it is implemented according to who implements it; an official who has a high sense of responsibility and revolutionary spirit, implements it without fail and in time whatever the difficulties, but an official who lacks such a sense and spirit, fails to implement it properly and only pays lip service to doing so. What we need are courageous officials who implement any task, however difficult, without complaint, not those who know only how to give ready answers and good accounts of their affairs. The more difficult the situation is, the more we need officials who have been transformed in a revolutionary fashion, officials who are men of action. Officials should not be people who pay only lip service or complain about conditions; they should be revolutionaries who face difficulties head-on and courageously. Ours is an excellent people, but economic work cannot be improved if officials fail to play their proper role. The leading economic officials who worked with President Kim Il Sung in the past, worked efficiently. Once he gave a task, they executed it responsibly. After the war, there were not many large power stations, like the Suphung Power Station, in our country. But the country did not experience difficulties due to a shortage of electricity, and carried out anything it decided. In those days people who had suffered hardships or had taken part in the revolutionary fight were responsible for economic work; though the difficulties were manifold, none of them complained about the bad conditions or  378 grew pessimistic. We should hold high the slogan of enhancing officials’ sense of responsibility and revolutionary spirit, first in the major industrial sectors in Jagang Province, and kindle the flame of struggle as was done in the 1950s. These days, the army is seconded to the major sites of socialist construction. The commanding officers of the army have a high revolutionary spirit. Party officials and leading administrative and economic officials should fight with the same devotion as the commanding officers of the army do, to implement even at the risk of their lives the tasks entrusted to them by the Party. All officials should cherish a Juche-based faith. Our workers are steadfast in their ideological viewpoint, but some officials are not. We should equip them with the ideas and policies of our Party and temper them in a revolutionary manner so as to ensure that they are firmly armed with the viewpoint of the working class and maintain the revolutionary faith. Officials should redouble their efforts, filled with confidence and optimism. There are many good signs now of the bright prospect for economic work. As the state of affairs at factories and enterprises in Jagang Province shows, the key to final victory in the forced march lies with the officials who are the commanding personnel of the revolution. Success in every kind of work depends on whether officials work with confidence. Even if they understand the economy, they cannot guide it properly if they lack confidence. Officials who work with confidence can be effective in economic work even though they do not understand the economy. Officials must repudiate defeatism. If they become pessimistic, they cannot do things they are fully capable of doing. Officials should solve problems that arise in economic work by their own efforts, like the anti-Japanese guerrillas who defeated the Japanese imperialists by making Yongil bombs with their bare hands. Officials should temper themselves ceaselessly, always consulting their conscience. Officials, who are constantly tempering themselves, never know failure in their work.  379 The workers have begun to be fired up in response to the militant call of the Party; Party organizations should stimulate their enthusiasm so as to spread the flames of a new Chollima upsurge across the country. All officials should mix with the workers and conduct effective organizational and political work to inspire them to a revolutionary upsurge; they should share weal and woe with the workers and rouse them so that they carry out their mission and duty. It would be a good idea to arrange visits to the factories in Jagang Province for officials; they can learn from the revolutionary character and spirit of self-reliance displayed by the workers there and their experience of laying out their factories neatly and running them efficiently. Visits to the factories in Jagang Province by officials of the central organs, senior provincial, city and county Party officials and secretaries of factory Party committees should be organized in a substantive manner. I firmly believe that all officials and working people will vigorously undertake the forced march for final victory by following the example of Jagang Province, and thus bring about a decisive turn in economic work and the people’s standard of living.",recent year jagang province achieve lot difficult condition arduous march true response party province build medium sized power station own effort

18.04.1998,Kim Jong Il,"We have recently observed the fifth anniversary of the publication of the Ten-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country and soon will greet the 50th anniversary of the historic Joint Conference of Representatives of Political Parties and Public Organizations in North and South Korea. The north-south joint conference, which was proposed by the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung and held under his guidance in Pyongyang in April 1948, was a historic national event to secure the destiny of the country and nation, by realizing the great unity of the entire nation under the banner of reunification and patriotism. At that time there was the danger that the division of the nation would be perpetuated because of the machinations of the US imperialists and their stooges who were trying to hold a “separate election” and establish a “separate government” in south Korea. The great Comrade Kim Il Sung convened the north-south joint conference and succeeded in uniting different political parties and groups as well as the patriotic  381 forces of different sections of the population in the north and the south, rendering remarkable services to the noble cause of realizing the sovereignty, independence and reunification of the country. In the extremely complex political situation in the years immediately after liberation, the representatives of nearly all the political parties and public organizations and even die-hard anti-communist nationalists in south Korea with the exception of a handful of traitors to the nation participated in the broad national conference. They reached a unanimous agreement and launched a nationwide patriotic struggle. This was a brilliant fruition of the great leader’s policy of independent national reunification and of his idea of great national unity as well as the first historic victory of the patriotic forces of reunification. The April north-south joint conference clearly showed that communists, nationalists and various other political forces and different sections of the population could get united in the struggle for the common cause of the nation, regardless of difference in ideology, ideals, political views and religious beliefs. It also demonstrated that the independent and peaceful reunification of the country could be realized through north-south harmony and the unity of the entire nation. The north-south joint conference became a reality thanks to the great leader’s painstaking efforts and his guidance. It will continue to be remembered for ever as a patriotic conference that demonstrated the great unity of our nation. On the occasion of its 50th anniversary, the conference and all its achievements shall inspire all the Koreans in the north, south and abroad to work harder for national unity and reunification with enthusiasm, confidence and courage. The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung clarified the question of nation in a fresh light on the basis of the Juche idea in his early years, advanced the original idea of great national unity and brilliantly applying it throughout the history of the struggle for national liberation, the building of a new country and the reunification of the country, set a noble example of great national unity. The great leader’s idea of great national unity encourages all  382 classes of society to unite solidly to safeguard and realize national independence by placing the common desire and interests of the nation above everything else regardless of difference in ideology and ideals, political views and religious beliefs, property status and social positions. The Juche idea scientifically elucidated for the first time the law of the development of the nation and the basis of national unity. The country and nation are the home of people as well as the basic unit for the people to shape their destiny. Since the people live and shape their destiny within the unit of the nation-state, the destiny of the members of the nation is inseparably linked with the destiny of the nation, and the basic question in shaping the nation’s destiny boils down to safeguarding and realizing national independence. Nobody can live separately from his country and nation, and no class and no section of the nation can shape its destiny properly unless the independence of the nation is ensured. A nation has its traits that have been shaped and consolidated historically as well as its common desire and interests that transcend the difference of classes and strata. The national traits and common interests constitute the basis of national unity on which to bind different classes and strata of the nation in a broad spectrum. The great leader’s idea of great national unity is a thorough idea of national independence, a noble idea of patriotism and an idea of a broadest national unity–an application of the Juche idea to the question of the nation. The question of national unity is all the more urgent in view of the unique traits of our nation and characteristics of the historical development of our country. Our nation, as a homogeneous one with time-honoured history and culture, is highly patriotic and strong in esprit de corps. One time in the past, however, our nation suffered the misfortune of losing its sovereignty because of the struggle for power among the corrupt and incompetent feudal rulers and as a result of their sycophantic and traitorous acts. In subsequent years, too, the nationalist movement and the early communist movement failed because of factional strife and sycophancy. The great leader’s idea of  383 great national unity is an outstanding idea that shows the absolutely correct way of preserving and highly displaying the excellence of our national traits, putting an end to the shameful history of national suffering and achieving the sovereignty and independence of the country and national prosperity. The Juche-oriented idea of great national unity elucidated by the respected Comrade Kim Il Sung, the author of the great Juche idea, ardent patriot, and man of broad calibre and magnanimity, provided our nation with a powerful ideological and spiritual weapon for achieving the great unity of the entire nation and for independently shaping the destiny of the country and nation. The Juche-oriented idea of great national unity is an original idea that raised the question of nation and the question of national unity in a fresh light and comprehensively and profoundly clarified them by reflecting the main trend of our times when all the oppressed nations and the people of all countries have achieved liberation and independence or are heading for independence. It is a great idea that has provided the world people with a correct guideline. It is the banner of struggle for victory in the cause of anti-imperialist independence. The respected leader’s elucidation of the Juche-oriented theory of nation and the idea of the great unity of the entire nation, which gave a new scientific clarification to the question of the nation and the question of national unity, constitutes one of his great ideological and theoretical achievements and a preeminent contribution to global independence and to humanity’s cause of independence. The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung not only advanced the idea of great national unity based on the Juche idea, but also worked with great pains all his life for the unity of our nation. During the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle the great leader united all the patriotic forces from all walks of life under the banner of resistance against Japan and led the anti-Japanese national liberation struggle to victory. The Association for the Restoration of the Fatherland organized in this period was the anti-Japanese national united front which embraced the broad patriotic forces–communists, nationalists,  384 workers, peasants, intellectuals, youths, students and even conscientious religious men and capitalists; this organization struck root deep in vast areas at home and abroad. In the course of the just struggle of all the anti-Japanese patriotic forces for national liberation under the guidance of the great leader, valuable experience was gained in achieving national unity and fine traditions were established in this work. After liberation the great leader raised the slogan “The entire nation must unite, those with strength contributing strength, those with knowledge devoting knowledge and those with money offering money to the building of a new country” and encouraged the people from all strata of society who love the country and nation to come out as one for the building of a democratic, independent and sovereign state. Owing to territorial and national division, the great unity of the entire nation became the most serious and urgent question vital to the destiny of the country and nation. From the first days of national division the great leader wisely guided the struggle to achieve great national unity under the banner of national reunification and thus developed the national reunification movement into a nationwide movement. He opened the way to dialogues and negotiations between the north and south, which had been tightly closed to each other and advanced the three principles of national reunification–independence, peaceful reunification and a great national unity–laying a solid foundation for national unity and national reunification. He guided the different sections of our compatriots in the north, south and abroad along the patriotic road to national unity and national reunification. The Ten-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country written by the great leader in the last days of his life is the summary of his idea of great national unity and his practical experience as well as an immortal document for great national unity. This programme elucidates the fundamental principles and the ideological basis to be maintained in achieving the  385 great unity of the nation and the specific tasks and ways of implementing them. The idea of great national unity, the ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation advanced by the great leader, the valuable experience he gained in his work for national unity and the brilliant results of his distinguished services are the eternal wealth of our country and nation and the solid foundation for great national unity and national reunification. Achieving great national unity and reunifying the country in our generation by defending and faithfully inheriting the great idea of national unity, brilliant achievements, rich experience and traditions left by the great leader is our unshakeable determination and will. True to the great leader’s idea of great national unity and his ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation, we must work for the great unity of all the Koreans in the north, south and abroad and achieve the independent, peaceful reunification of the country by the united efforts of the nation. Our nation is the motive force of national reunification, which means reconnecting the severed blood ties between the north and the south and realizing national unity. Without reconciliation between north and south and great national unity, the independent, peaceful reunification of the country would be inconceivable. The great unity of the entire nation means national reunification. Today, the great unity of our nation and national reunification have become a more urgent question than before. In view of the situation at home and abroad, the fundamental interests of our nation and the trend of the times, it is the right time for us to save the destiny of the country and nation through the great unity of the entire nation and demonstrate the dignity and honour of a reunified country and one nation. Putting an end to the tragedy of territorial division and national split that has lasted over half a century and achieving national unity and the country’s reunification are the vital demands and the supreme task of the nation that must not be delayed any longer. The longer the division remained, the greater the misfortunes and sufferings of our nation  386 would be, and the greater the risks of the nation becoming heterogeneous. Further distrust and confrontation between the north and the south might invite national calamity. The foreign forces, which do not like Korea’s reunification, are now fanning confrontation between the north and the south in an attempt to fish in troubled waters; the imperialists are intensifying their plot of dominating the world under the pretext of “globalization.” If our country remained in confrontation, divided into north and south, in such a complex and threatening situation as today, our nation would be unable to free itself from foreign domination and subjugation, playing into the hands of foreign forces, and might be reduced to colonial slavery. Nobody with a Korean soul can shut his eyes to national unity and national reunification. Trying to delay the solution to the reunification problem, shutting his eyes to it, amounts to an attempt to perpetuate division. Our nation must overcome all difficulties and obstacles standing in the way of national reunification, achieve the great unity of the nation as soon as possible, and reunify the country. We are sure that the country can be reunified. It is not two different nations that stand in confrontation in the north and south of Korea, but it is one nation on the same land that is divided artificially by foreign forces. The Korean nation is a homogeneous nation that has inherited the same blood and lived in the same territory speaking the same language for thousands of years. All the Koreans in the north, south and abroad belong to the same nation with the blood and soul of the Korean nation and are linked inseparably with the same national interests and the common national psychology and sentiments. No force can ever split into two for ever the single Korean nation that has been formed and developed through a long history, nor can it obliterate our nation and our national traits. The present division of our nation into north and south is a temporary misfortune and a tragedy in the context of 5 000 years of its history. The reunion of our nation that has been divided by foreign forces is an inevitable trend of our nation’s history and the law of national development.  387 In the past, the Japanese imperialists resorted to every conceivable scheme to annihilate our nation, occupying our country and enforcing the most heinous colonial rule. However, the Korean revolutionaries and patriots launched a bloody struggle to save the country and the nation, and finally destroyed Japanese imperialism and liberated their country. After the defeat of Japanese imperialism, the US imperialists occupied south Korea, lording it over there, trampling upon our national sovereignty, and trying tenaciously to keep our nation divided for ever. But the spirit of the nation remains alive among the south Korean people. Broad sections of the people in south Korea, particularly the young people and students, continue to fight bravely against the domination of foreign forces and the treachery of the south Korean rulers. This is a manifestation of the national indignation of south Korean brothers who resist tyranny and humiliation and of the unbreakable spirit of our nation. The national trend towards reunification is mounting higher with each passing day. It would be impossible to break or check our nation’s will and desire to reunify the country through the unity of the entire nation. We must redouble our efforts to achieve the great unity of the entire nation and the independent and peaceful reunification of the country, full of confidence and optimism. Great national unity must be based thoroughly on the principle of national independence. National independence is the lifeblood of a nation; safeguarding independence is a fundamental guarantee for a nation’s existence and development. Only when we adhere to the principle of national independence can we defend the national rights and interests, shape the nation’s destiny independently in keeping with the will and demand of our nation, and fully exercise our sovereignty on the international arena and develop the relations with foreign countries on the principles of complete equality and mutual benefit. National independence is the source of national dignity and honour, pride and self-confidence, as well as the indomitable will and spirit of the  388 nation. If a nation loses its independence and fails to get rid of domination and subjugation by foreign forces, it will be unable to avoid humiliation and insult and being a ruined nation with its rights and interests, its traits and dignity downtrodden. The principle of national independence is the key to the question of nation and the very basis of the great unity of the entire nation. It requires that the nation should fight in unity against domination and subjugation by foreign forces and for its independence. Our struggle for the great unity of the entire nation is precisely a struggle to achieve our national sovereignty across the whole country, a struggle to accomplish the cause of national reunification by our own national force, and ensure the independent development of the reunified country and the common prosperity of the nation. Both great national unity and national reunification are aimed at preserving the independence of the country and the nation. The principle of national independence is a touchstone that distinguishes patriotism from treachery to the nation, the line of reunification from the line of division. Claiming for independence and north-south reconciliation and unity while pursuing the policy of dependence on foreign forces is nothing but empty talk. Just as patriotism is incompatible with treachery to the nation, so is national independence incompatible with dependence on foreign forces. He who truly desires north-south reconciliation, national unity and national reunification must follow the road of national independence, not the path of dependence on foreign forces. National unity is always aimed at defending and realizing national independence; it is inconceivable to talk about national unity apart from the principle of national independence. Only when we achieve the great unity of the entire nation on the basis of the principle of national independence can our nation become a true master of its destiny, a strong driving and decisive force of national reunification and national prosperity. We must categorically oppose and reject sycophancy to great powers and dependence on foreign forces, and achieve great national unity on the basis of the principle of national independence.  389 The entire nation must unite under the banner of patriotism, the banner of national reunification. Loving one’s country and nation and cherishing one’s national traits are the common psychology and sentiment of the members of the nation. Ours is a nation with strong national character, cherishing ardent love for the country and fellow countrymen and treasuring and inheriting the national soul. Our nation’s patriotic spirit and inherent traits form a strong ideological and spiritual basis of the great unity of the whole nation. Moreover, to our nation that has suffered all types of misfortune and pains caused by national division, national reunification is a supreme national demand, and the banner of national reunification is the banner of common national struggle, the banner of great unity of the whole nation. The entire nation must achieve great unity for the great common cause of the nation, on the basis of the inherent traits of the Korean nation. There are a variety of differences, including those in ideology and system between north and south that have been kept divided for over half a century. However, the national community as one nation is far greater than them. The demands and interests of different classes and strata of the nation are different from one another; but the primary task facing our nation today is national reunification, and we must subordinate everything to the cause of national reunification. If we regard the difference in ideology and system between north and south as absolute, and put aside the national community and the common interests of the nation while bringing the interests of individual classes and strata to the fore, we can achieve neither great national unity nor national reunification. All the Koreans in the north, south and abroad must unite closely under the banner of patriotism, the banner of national reunification, irrespective of their difference in ideology and system, political views and religious beliefs, transcending the interests of classes and strata. All the members of the nation–workers, farmers, intellectuals, young people and students, the urban petty-bourgeoisie, national capitalists, politicians, businesspeople, men of culture, religious men and  390 soldiers–must fight in unity for national reunification, and make an active contribution to the cause of national reunification. It is our steadfast standpoint and consistent policy to embrace and unite all the people who cherish the soul of the nation and all the people who love the country and nation, irrespective of their ideology and system, class and stratum, for the great unity of the entire nation. Our all-embracing politics is the politics of noble love for humanity that embraces everybody with loving care. It is the most magnanimous and patriotic politics that unites all the classes and strata of the nation rock-solid for the common cause of the country and nation. We will invariably carry on the all-embracing politics on the road to national unity and country’s reunification, unite with anybody with national conscience and aspiration to the country’s reunification and advance hand in hand in the same rank for the country’s reunification. People who have taken a wrong path in the past can repent of their mistakes and embark on the road of patriotism. On the principle of asking no question about the past, we will approach with generosity those who went the wrong way against the nation in the past, but now truly repent of their mistakes and try to contribute to the cause of national reunification, and will advance with them for national reunification. We will also unite with people from upper classes in power, figures from the ruling party and the opposition parties, big capitalists and generals under the banner of great unity of the nation, if they value the common interests of the nation and want the reunification of the country. Once we join hands with people, we will cooperate with them not only on the road to national reunification but also in the struggle for the prosperity of the reunified country and will highly evaluate, in the name of the nation, those who have made contribution to national reunification. The north and south must improve their relations in order to achieve the great unity of our nation. To replace the relations of distrust and confrontation between  391 north and south with those of trust and reconciliation is a pressing requirement for national unity and national reunification. The successive south Korean authorities have obstructed harmony between the north and the south with their anti-north confrontation policy that regards the fellow countrymen as enemies and foments hostility and discord among the nation and hindered the great unity of the nation in every way. The south Korean authorities’ anti-north confrontation policy is the root that gives rise to misunderstanding and distrust between north and south. It is the stumbling block to the improvement of the north-south relations and national unity. If the south Korean authorities continue to pursue the hostile anti-north confrontation policy, it will be impossible to create an atmosphere of trust and reconciliation between north and south. It will only increase tension and bring about an irretrievable result. When different ideologies and systems exist in the north and the south, denial of the other side’s ideology and system will make it impossible to avoid confrontation. The north and the south, on the basis of recognizing the existence of the different ideologies and systems, must achieve harmony, promote coexistence, co-prosperity and common interests and open the way to national reunification. Whoever is hostile to his fellow countrymen and pursues the anti-north confrontation policy with the backing of foreign forces and in cooperation with them, will be cursed and condemned by the people and cannot escape the judgement of history. This can be illustrated by the wretched ends of successive rulers of south Korea. If the south Korean authorities do not want to follow in the footsteps of their predecessors, they should learn a lesson from their ends and make a resolute decision to break with the outmoded anti-north confrontation. If the south Korean authorities change their policy and convert the anti-north confrontation policy into reconciliation policy of alliance with the north, the relations between the north and the south will develop into those of trust and reconciliation and a new phase be opened for national unity and national reunification. The south Korean authorities must change their anti-north confrontation policy into reconciliation policy of alliance with the north  392 from a patriotic standpoint and take the road of national reconciliation and unity. In south Korea the fascist laws and machinery that obstruct the unity of the nation and the reunification of the country must be abolished and all sorts of political barriers removed. Our position in relation to the south Korean authorities is clear. We were against the successive rulers of south Korea not because they were in power. We were opposed to their policy of dependence on foreign forces, their policy against reunification, and their treachery to the country and nation. If the south Korean authorities take the patriotic stand, the stand of unity in alliance with the north, we will work with them to shape the destiny of the nation. For the great unity of our nation, we must reject domination and interference of the foreign forces and fight against the traitors to the nation, the anti-reunification forces, who are in collusion with the foreign forces. Domination and interference of the foreign forces is the major obstacle to the unity of our nation and the reunification of the country. Our nation has been divided into north and south by the foreign forces, and the country and nation have not yet been reunified because of their domination and interference. Dividing and ruling other nations is a stereotyped method used by imperialists. In disregard of the demand of our nation for national reunification and running against the trend of the age of independence, the United States is pursuing as ever its ambition to keep our nation divided for ever and rule it. It is aggravating the situation by fomenting antagonism and discord among our nation, instigating the south Korean authorities to confrontation against their fellow countrymen, continuing to keep its troops in south Korea and ceaselessly stepping up war exercises and military buildup. Under the instigation and manipulation of the foreign forces, the successive south Korean rulers have built the wall of division, intensified the political and military confrontation between north and south, put down the south Korean people, who seek independence, democracy and national reunification, and resorted to every scheme  393 to divide and disintegrate the patriotic, democratic force that fights for reunification. Without fighting against the domination and interference of the foreign forces and the divisive force at home and abroad, it would be impossible to realize unity between north and south, the great unity of the nation and the reunification of the country. Through a nationwide struggle against the domination and interference of the foreign forces, all the Koreans in the north, south and abroad must root up the cause of obstruction to national unity and reunification. They must also launch a resolute struggle against the anti-reunification policies and the schemes for national division pursued by the traitors to the nation, who collaborate with the foreign forces for their personal wealth and power with no regard for the destiny of the country and nation. The patriotic, democratic force that fights for reunification must heighten their vigilance against the cunning machinations of the divisive elements aimed at wedge-driving and disintegration and counter them by the force of unity. All the political parties, organizations and public figures and people from various social strata who love the country and nation and seek reunification must regard the great cause of national unity and reunification as a supreme demand, strengthen their unity, continue to expand the patriotic ranks for reunification and organize them on a solid basis. For the great unity of the nation all the Koreans in the north, south and abroad must visit one another, hold contacts, promote dialogue and strengthen solidarity. Promoting wide-ranging visits, contacts, dialogues and solidarity among our compatriots is an important way to achieve the great unity of the nation. Even though there is difference in ideologies, ideals, political views and religious beliefs within our nation, the fellow countrymen can build up mutual understanding and trust and pool their will and efforts for the common objective of the nation if they all freely travel, hold contacts and dialogues and strengthen solidarity. Cherishing the noble ideals of great national unity and national reunification, all our  394 compatriots in the north, south and abroad must strive to realize travel, contact, dialogue and organizational solidarity. Dialogue between north and south must serve national unity and reunification. No one must make use of the dialogue to pursue dishonest political objectives or to perpetuate the division of the country. The dialogue must be held on the principle of giving precedence to the common interests of the nation, eliminating distrust and confrontation between north and south and subordinating everything to reunifying the country. The dialogue must not be the monopoly of a few men in authorities or of a particular class or section. It must be an all-embracing, nationwide dialogue that can pool the opinions of all political parties, groups and social sections. The dialogue must be participated in by the representatives of all political parties and social organizations including the authorities, and public figures and people from various walks of life in the north and south and the overseas compatriots. Bilateral and multilateral dialogues and negotiations of various forms must be promoted. The great unity of the entire nation will be realized and consolidated in the course of developing joint actions in solidarity in the struggle for national reunification. All the political parties, organizations and fellow countrymen in the north, south and abroad must support and keep pace with one another, taking joint action in the effort for the reunification of the country. The struggle of our nation for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country is now entering a new historical phase. The road to reunification is still beset with many obstacles and difficulties, but we are optimistic about its future. Our nation is one, and so is our country. Our nation will achieve great unity under the banner of national reunification without fail. I am convinced that the whole nation in the north, south and abroad will realize the historic cause of national reunification through united effort in our generation, true to the great leader Comrade

01.01.1999,Kim Jong Il,"We have rung out a year in which we proudly continued the forced march for final victory, and rung in the hope-filled New Year 1999. This year will be one of an all-out charge for effecting a fresh advance in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country. I went over the draft New Year joint editorial of Rodong Sinmun, Joson Inmingun and Chongnyon Jonwi several times, and ensured that it put forward the slogan “Let us make this year one in which a major advance is made in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country!” This is a good slogan. It reflects the confidence of our Party and people in victory and their indomitable will to build on this socialist land, Kim Il Sung’s country, a great, prosperous and powerful nation true to President Kim Il Sung’s wish. To build a great, prosperous and powerful country was President Kim Il Sung’s will and gigantic objective. By a great, prosperous and powerful country, I mean a thriving socialist country. It will be a country where the national strength is great, everything prospers and the people are living without envying anything in the world.  416 To build our country into a great, prosperous and powerful country–this must never be empty talk or something for the distant future. Since a long time ago I have been formulating a plan for building a great, prosperous and powerful country, true to President Kim Il Sung’s wish, and made preparations for it. Proceeding from the unique circumstances in our country, I have advanced the principle of Songun-based revolutionary leadership and paid primary attention to strengthening the Korean People’s Army, thus developing it into an invincible armed force; I have also ensured that all the people defend the leadership of the revolution to the death and work more strenuously for the completion of the revolutionary cause of Juche under the leadership of the Party by learning from the revolutionary soldier spirit. In the course of the socialist forced march that followed the Arduous March our politico-ideological might, the single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks, has been further consolidated, and it has become invincible so that no force can break it. While guiding army units and the work of various sectors in provinces, I have seen to it that the foundations have been laid for bringing about a fresh improvement in economic construction and the people’s lives. From early January last year I gave guidance at the major factories and enterprises that are of key importance in economic construction, encouraging the working class, the vanguard unit in the construction of a great, prosperous and powerful country, to ride Chollima once again in a race against time. I visited Jagang Province on several occasions to go among the workers, kindle the flame of a new revolutionary upsurge and inspire the entire working class to build a great, prosperous and powerful country. Last year all our Party members, soldiers and people, upholding the Party’s militant slogan “Forward on the forced march for final victory!” worked vigorously and indefatigably in the Kanggye spirit and holding high the torch of Songgang; in this way they overcame the hardest time and ushered in  417 a period of upsurge for turning the Arduous March into a march to paradise. Nowadays many sectors of the national economy are operating more briskly, and there are signs that the country’s economy is being reinvigorated. The Huichon General Machine Tool Factory has fulfilled the machine-tool production task given it by the Party, and is advancing towards a higher goal; the Amnokgang Tyre Factory and the Sungni General Motor Works have begun to make innovations in production by redoubling their efforts. The many small- and medium-sized power stations built in various parts of the country through a mass drive have made a considerable contribution to easing the strain on the electricity supply, and a significant success has been achieved in the development of natural resources. The agricultural sector has brought about a revolution and thus laid a new foundation for solving the food problem and developing wide-scale stockbreeding and silkworm raising. Since we have succeeded in laying solid foundations for building a thriving country through an arduous struggle lasting several years, building a great, prosperous and powerful country is an undertaking that can be implemented in the near future and is quite feasible. The world recognizes that our country has already attained the status of a great, prosperous and powerful country in the politico-ideological and military aspects. If we concentrate on economic construction and thus put all the factories and enterprises back on a normal track and ensure that they run at full capacity, then our country will surely attain the status of an economic giant. I am going to have the existing factories and enterprises shored up one after another and run on a normal footing, new and modern iron works and cement factories built and the construction of large-scale hydroelectric power stations stepped up so that they can be completed at an early date. Then we will be able to supply by ourselves all the things needed for the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country, and we will have nothing to fear. And if the agricultural sector obtains high-yielding species, produces composite microbial  418 fertilizer in large quantities, increases the area of double-cropping and realigns crop fields on an extensive scale to facilitate the comprehensive mechanization of the rural economy, then our country will become rich in grain. It is my plan and firm determination to have a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country built as quickly as possible on this land of ours, so that the country will become formidable, and the people will lead a happy life free from worries of any kind. Now that the order for an advance in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country has been issued, we should work well this year and thus achieve a fresh breakthrough. A breakthrough in building our country into an economic giant should be achieved first in solving the problems of electricity and food. It is only when the problem of electricity is solved that coal, iron, machinery, fertilizers and grain can be produced, the strain on rail transport eased and all other problems solved, thus making it possible to put production at factories and enterprises back on a normal footing and the overall economy of the country on a regular track. At the moment, factories and enterprises have all the equipment they need and the ideological and spiritual state of their workforces are good and sound; if they are supplied only with enough electricity and raw materials, they can all return to operation and normalize their production at a high level. The problem of raw materials can be solved in the same way that the Huichon General Machine Tool Factory and the Sungni General Motor Works did, but the problem of electricity cannot be solved in that way. Therefore, a breakthrough should be achieved first in the electric power industry; we should direct every effort to solving this problem. To this end, we should build large hydroelectric power stations while taking revolutionary measures for running the existing power stations at full capacity. We should step up the construction of the Anbyon Youth Power Station and the Thaechon Power Station so that they can be inaugurated at an early date and build the Huichon, Kumyagang and Pochon power stations. We should continue to build  419 in a mass drive small- and medium-sized power stations in all the places where there is flowing water. In order to solve the problem of electricity in our country’s conditions, we should keep up with the construction of both large power stations and small- and medium-sized ones, and each one should be built in such a way that it pays off immediately. A decisive improvement should be brought about in the food situation. Only then can we ensure that all the people across the country rise up to build a great, prosperous and powerful country. Factories are run by people, and construction and production are also performed by people. If a person does not eat, he can do nothing. The food situation in the country is under great strain owing to the imperialists’ schemes for economic blockade and the succession of natural calamities in recent years; but we cannot step up the new march without first bringing about an improvement in the food situation. In order to improve the food situation, we should produce potatoes on a large scale by effecting a revolution in potato farming, and quickly increase grain production. The mountainous regions like Ryanggang Province, and such regions as North and South Hamgyong provinces and Kangwon Province which are seriously affected by cold weather, should widely cultivate potato species that yield more than 60 tons per hectare. If the seeds of excellent, high-yielding potato species are secured, tubers are planted and liquid manure is applied in large quantities, we will reap a rich potato harvest. Potatoes are as good as rice, so if we produce plenty of potatoes, we will be able to eat them as a staple food, and certain amounts of corn and potatoes can be used as animal feed for the production of meat. We should bring about an improvement in the seeds not only in potato farming but in all other areas of agricultural production, introduce composite microbial fertilizer actively and undertake double-cropping on a wide scale, so as to produce grain in larger quantities. Land realignment should be conducted as a mass drive. In our country, where the area of crop land is limited, a major reserve for  420 increased grain production lies in land realignment. Land realignment is also necessary for the future comprehensive mechanization of the rural economy. Crop fields should be realigned not in a short-sighted way, but with an eye to the distant future. We should ensure that the whole country works to make the land realignment project in Kangwon Province a model project, and popularize its experience in realigning crop fields across the rest of the country. We should give importance to military affairs, and continue to focus a major effort on the defence industry. Military affairs are the most important aspect of state affairs, and the defence industry is the lifeline in the building of a thriving country. Separated from military affairs and defence industry, we can neither build our country into an economic giant nor ensure the security of the country and people. In our country, military affairs are the priority, and so is the defence industry. Had we not strengthened our defence capabilities as we have done despite the difficulties, we would have been vanquished by the US imperialists long ago. While directing great efforts to the defence industry, we should solve the problem of the people’s living at an early date. This year funds will be defrayed for the light industry sector in order to shore up the factories that produce cloth, footwear and other goods that are essential for the people in their lives and thus solve the problem of daily necessaries. We should also make funds available for the public health sector in order to produce household medicines and other medicines in large quantities and demonstrate the advantages of our socialist health-care system. If we are to greet the 55th anniversary of the founding of the Party with proud successes in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country, it is important to build monumental structures well. In particular, we should focus on building up Pyongyang so as to lay out the capital city of the revolution in a magnificent way. Pyongyang is the heart of Korea, where the leadership of the revolution is located. Building up Pyongyang is not a simple economic and business undertaking, but an important political undertaking for  421 demonstrating the revolutionary mettle of heroic Korea and imbuing the whole country with the vigour of the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country. We should vigorously expedite the development of the capital city and make a splendid job of the major projects for commemorating the 55th anniversary of the founding of the Party, so as to make them monuments to the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country. We should build a great, prosperous and powerful country under the banner of self-reliance. The building of a great, prosperous and powerful country is an undertaking to build a thriving country on this land by ourselves, using our own strength, technology and resources. We may be short of many things and face many difficulties in the course of building such a country. But we can never solve our problems by relying on others. We must never be captivated by the “restructuring” and “openness” advertised so much by the imperialists. “Restructuring” and “openness” are the way to national ruin. We must not tolerate them to the slightest degree. Ours will be a great, prosperous and powerful country based on self-reliance. It is my plan to develop the economy based on the already-built foundations and assets of our independent national economy. We must build a great, prosperous and powerful country in our own fashion based on the solid foundations of the independent socialist national economy President Kim Il Sung laid during his lifetime. During my recent inspection of the Sungni General Motor Works, I found that the material and technological foundations for vehicle production are sound. President Kim Il Sung furnished the motor works with excellent technological equipment. During my inspection I expressed my determination to have vehicle production boosted by relying on the existing foundations; the officials and workers there fully supported my determination and said that they would bring about innovations in vehicle production without fail. We should develop the country’s economy by holding higher the banner of self-reliance.  422 In order to build a great, prosperous and powerful country, we should effect a fresh change in Party work. Party organizations and Party workers should conduct effective organizational and political work for rousing all cadres, Party members and other working people for the effort to build a great, prosperous and powerful country. The core force in building a great, prosperous and powerful country is the working class. Our working class have performed their mission and duty as the leading class and core unit of the revolution in every period and at every stage of our revolution, from the building of a new country and postwar reconstruction to socialist construction. Whenever our revolution has experienced trials, they have defended and supported their Party and their leader with increased production. Thanks to our faithful working class, we have been able to lay the solid foundations of an independent national economy and open bright prospects for building a thriving country. Our Party believes that the working class will play the vanguard role again in effecting an epochal turning point in building a great, prosperous and powerful country as they have done in the past. Party organizations should ensure that the workers are fully aware of their mission and duty and normalize production at a high level, holding aloft the torch of Songgang, and thus demonstrate once again the mettle of the working class of Juche Korea. Party organizations should conduct political work at production sites as it is done at the battle front and dispatch well-organized motivational art troupes to the major factories and enterprises so as to make them seethe with activity. The agricultural working people are directly responsible for agricultural production, which is the main foundation for building a great, prosperous and powerful country. Party organizations should rouse them to increase agricultural production so that they play their full role in achieving a breakthrough in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country. Young people are the most vigorous unit and a shock force in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country. When they are  423 ready to devote the prime of their lives and burning hearts, there is nothing they cannot do. Our Party is now calling on them to join the gigantic struggle for building a great, prosperous and powerful country. Party organizations should motivate them to perform heroic feats at the sites of socialist construction in response to the Party’s call, and become the Ri Su Boks and Kil Yong Jos of today. Science and technology are a powerful propellant for building a great, prosperous and powerful country. We cannot build such a country without advanced science and technology. Scientists and technicians, by upholding the Party’s intentions, should devote all their wisdom and energy to solving the scientific and technological problems arising in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country. Party organizations should pay close attention to consolidating the class position of our revolution. The imperialists and reactionaries are now scheming more viciously to stifle our socialism. Our effort to build a great, prosperous and powerful country is a serious class struggle waged amidst the obstructive moves of the enemy of every description. Because we are in a sharp confrontation with the enemy, we cannot build an everlasting great, prosperous and powerful socialist country on this land without consolidating our class position; we may end up slaves of the enemy. Party organizations should build up the ranks of cadres with those who are faithful to the Party, and educate them effectively. They should not confine themselves simply to selecting such people and appointing them as cadres, but meet them frequently to inquire about their lives and work and, when mistakes are revealed, give them timely criticism so that they rectify them. They should establish a revolutionary way of Party life among cadres and Party members to see to it that they work and live according to strict Party discipline. They should also intensify anti-US and class education among Party members and other working people so that they fight staunchly against the class enemy of all hues, with high class consciousness. The Party should give guidance to administrative and economic  424 affairs, as required by the new state structure. Party organizations and Party workers should eliminate the tendency of taking administrative affairs upon themselves; they should throw their weight behind the Cabinet and give it effective Party-oriented assistance so that it can perform all economic work on its own responsibility. We readjusted the state structure last year. We should make sure that the Cabinet, as the economic headquarters, implements the Cabinet-responsibility system, Cabinet-centred system. Only then can we ensure the centralized and unified guidance of economic affairs. All problems related to economic work should be brought to the Cabinet and solved according to the decisions and under the supervision of the Cabinet. No unit should handle such problems on its own volition, without bringing them to the Cabinet. Strong discipline should be established whereby the decisions and directives of the Cabinet and its commissions and ministries are strictly observed. These decisions and directives all reflect the Party’s intention, and are aimed at implementing its economic policies. If officials are insincere in their attitude and fail to implement the decisions and directives properly, the Cabinet cannot play its role as the economic headquarters, and the Party’s economic policies cannot be carried out. Party organizations should ensure that officials adopt a proper attitude to the decisions and directives of the Cabinet and its commissions and ministries and carry them out without condition. They should take issue with any tendency towards adopting an insincere attitude to these decisions and directives or attempting to compromise, and wage a struggle against it without delay so as to ensure that such a tendency is never revealed again. Economic officials should undertake the planning and command of economic work properly. Whether the overall economy of the country is put back on track or not depends largely on how economic officials undertake planning and command. The worse the conditions are, the more correct the planning and the more effective the command should be; only then can an upsurge be achieved in  425 production and construction. Last year’s experience testifies to this; those units whose officials did careful planning and worked strenuously with a high sense of responsibility and revolution, achieved success, while those whose officials did not work in that way, failed to do even that which was within their reach. Party organizations should lead economic officials to gain awareness that the heavy task of building a great, prosperous and powerful country rests on their shoulders, and undertake planning and command properly. Officials should bring about a fundamental change in their way and style of work, in conformity with the new circumstances and environment. They should acquire the revolutionary habit of carrying out their tasks even at the risk of their lives by displaying an inflexible fighting spirit and devotion, standing in the vanguard holding the banner of building a great, prosperous and powerful country. Today our Party needs officials who are capable of leading the masses while playing the most important and difficult roles themselves. Officials should always stand in the vanguard leading the masses and put their shoulders to the wheel to solve problems; by doing so they will become standard-bearers and men of action. Party organizations should see to it that all officials lead the masses by setting personal examples as they shout, not “Charge!” but “Forward after me!” as the officers of the People’s Army do. Officials, when they are to discuss a problem at a consultation, should organize the meeting in a brief, clear and militant fashion. Long consultations do not necessarily produce good methods of solving problems or lead to successful solutions. Engaging in empty talk in a consultation is not conducive to today’s militant atmosphere, when a gigantic struggle is going on. I hold as few consultations as possible; when I have to, I assign tasks quickly and conclude them. Holding consultations and talking a lot at them are pointless. The key is how to work in practice. In conformity with the changing circumstances and conditions, officials should learn how to maintain  426 the core of their work and organize and develop their work in a flexible manner. Officials should become persons of prestige who are trusted, followed and respected by the people. The masses’ trust in officials does not come on a silver platter; it is produced when the latter respect the former, are sincere to them and work with devotion for their interests. The masses respect and follow such officials who value them and work sincerely to resolve their difficulties. It is only when all officials become the devoted servants of the people and respected by them that the single-hearted unity between the Party and the masses will be further solidified. This is why I emphasize that officials should always go among the people to share weal and woe with them. They must never, like oil floating on water, be separated from the people. Following their leaders, they should work more for the people. President Kim Il Sung, viewing “The people are my God” as his motto, devoted his whole life to the struggle for the people’s freedom and happiness. I, true to his noble intention, will devote my all to the people, believing in them as in heaven. To work with whole-hearted devotion for the building of a thriving country and for the people’s well-being–this is the goal and value of my life. Officials should decisively rid themselves of the abuse of authority and bureaucratism, and acquire a people-oriented way of working. Officials who try to feather their own nests by abusing their authority and working like bureaucrats are not capable of leading the masses. With the attitude and stand that they have nothing more to expect if the people are leading an abundant life even though they themselves are not so well-off, officials should work with devotion solely for the people’s interests and well-being. I believe that all officials, clearly aware of the Party’s plans and intentions, will bring about a turn in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country by efficiently organizing this year’s work and rousing the whole Party, the entire army and all the people.",ring proudly continue force march final victory ring hope fill new charge effect fresh advance building prosperous over

01.01.2000,Kim Jong Il,"Today we greet New Year 2000, a year filled with hope. Last year was a year of great change, when the whole Party, the entire army and all the people rose up as one for the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country in response to the Party’s militant call, and achieved successes we can be proud of. The schemes of the imperialists and reactionaries to isolate and stifle our country, a bulwark of socialism, were as vicious as ever, and the natural and climate conditions were very unfavourable, but none of these things could check the advance of our people, who are racing ahead to build their country into a great, prosperous and powerful one. In the course of the arduous struggle, the country’s ideological and military power became further strengthened, the various sectors of the economy have begun to revive one after another, and a bright prospect has been opened for improving the people’s standard of living in the near future. This gives us a firmer conviction that as long as we have the Party’s leadership and excellent people we can surmount any trials and difficulties, and build a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country on this land without fail by our own efforts. 1 The year 2000 is a significant year, as it marks the 55th anniversary of the founding of our glorious Party, and a year of general charge, when we have to make a decisive advance in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country. In order to see to it that the 55th anniversary of Party founding is greeted as a great festival of victors, I had the organs of the Party, the army and the youth league publish a joint editorial on New Year’s Day. I thought over and over on how to title the joint editorial, and finally decided that it should be Glorify This Year That Marks the 55th Anniversary of Party Founding as a Year of Proud Victory in the Flames of the Great Chollima Upsurge. This title is at the same time a militant slogan we should hold up in the course of our advance. The joint editorial contains all that our Party plans and intends. It is a policy statement of our Party. Other countries are now giving wide publicity to the joint editorial, saying that it clarifies the direction Korea will follow this year. Our people’s efforts to build a great, prosperous and powerful country are still difficult and complicated. This year, too, we must overcome many trials and hardships, and struggle with extraordinary preparedness and determination. Whether the tasks facing us this year are carried out with success or not is dependent entirely on how Party work is conducted. We should further intensify Party work as demanded by the developing revolution so as to make a decisive advance this year in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country, and greet the 55th anniversary of the Party’s founding as a grand festival of victors. We should continue to direct great efforts to further consolidating the single-hearted unity between the Party and the revolutionary ranks. Single-hearted unity is the solid foundation of our revolution and a powerful weapon for accomplishing the cause of socialism. Our revolution was started by dint of unity, and has been safeguarded and advanced on the strength of unity. The source of invincible strength at all the stages of the development of our revolution has always been 2 unity. We have broken through the isolate-and-stifle schemes of the imperialist allied forces and the economic difficulties and defended the red flag of socialism by dint of the unity between the leader, the Party and the masses. The proud successes we achieved last year are also attributable to the fact that the masses fought devotedly by placing their invariable trust in the Party and rallying behind it singleheartedly. Single-hearted unity is the lifeline of our socialist cause and a precious sword in our struggle for victory. We should accomplish the cause of building a great, prosperous and powerful country and achieve victory in the accomplishing of the cause of socialism in 2000 by maintaining single-hearted unity as we have defended the red flag of revolution by means of that unity. We should ensure that all the people place absolute trust in the Party and the leader, and follow them with sincerity. Faithfulness to the Party and the leader is the core of single-hearted unity, and it is based on absolute worship of the leader. The road ahead of our revolution is still long and beset with difficulties. We should ensure that all the people firmly trust the Party and share their destiny with it at all times and at all places on this road. All the people unanimously yearning for and following the Party and the leader–this is singlehearted unity. I said that there is a song we should sing in the future too. It is Where Are You, Dear General? sung by the heroine of the revolutionary opera A True Daughter of the Party. While guiding the creation of this opera, I personally wrote the lyrics of this song to portray the feeling of the heroine who yearns for Supreme Commander Kim Il Sung. The road to the hospital on Mt Thaebaek the heroine follows is the road to the leader in the Supreme Headquarters. Where Are You, Dear General? is a song that depicts well the worship of the leader and the spirit of defending him unto death. Though it was created in the 1970s, it reflects the faithfulness of our soldiers and people in the days of the Fatherland Liberation War, who yearned for their leader and followed him to the end. By means of this song, we should ensure that the faithfulness of the soldiers and people to their leader in the 1950s is implanted in the hearts of the new 3 generation. We should ensure that should another war break out, our soldiers and people win it singing the song of yearning for the Supreme Headquarters as the soldiers and people won the Fatherland Liberation War yearning for their leader and fighting with the feeling that they could win only when they were rallied behind the Supreme Headquarters. We should see to it that the whole of the country resounds with the melody of the song so that worship of the leader and the spirit of defending him unto death are produced abundantly in the 2000s, too, forming the ranks of single-hearted unity. It should be ensured that all the people work with one mind cherishing revolutionary comradeship. Love between comrades is itself a form of unity, and the sincerer and warmer comradeship is, the purer and more solid the singlehearted unity becomes. This is why I especially treasure comradely love and obligation. At this moment, when we are greeting the New Year, I recollect with particularly deep emotion those who have followed President Kim Il Sung and the Party invariably in the past in the face of all trials and difficulties, at the same time as thinking how to celebrate the 55th anniversary of Party founding in a significant way. Love between revolutionary comrades should be sincere. The last five years have been a period full of severe trials for our revolution. In the course of undergoing these trials, our officials have been tested. Our officials should become not sham revolutionary comrades feigning smiles, but true companions who would come back to their Supreme Commander without fail even from the jaws of death. I love Song of Comradeship. The major point in this song is the part that runs We must take the revolutionary road rain or shine/Let us be true to our oath/ We look up to Hanbyol, our lodestar in the second stanza. We should continue to apply benevolent politics, all-embracing politics, to the letter to see to it that all the people rally behind the Party with sincerity. By applying benevolent politics, all-embracing politics, we have rallied the Party and the revolutionary ranks as an 4 integrated whole. I still remember what happened a few years ago when I was inspecting the tramline-laying project site in front of the Kumsusan Memorial Palace. When I was inspecting the finished project on a tram, many people, including students, who had been laying out the surrounding area, recognized me from afar, and crowded to the running tram waving their hands and cheering with tears in their eyes. Witnessing the scene, I was resolved to work all the harder for the benefit of my people; I was also convinced that if we rallied these excellent people, we would have no enemy to be afraid of and nothing we could not do. Ours are an excellent people, indeed. Work with people should be done with prudence, and such a practice as dealing thoughtlessly with the issues concerning them should be eliminated. In every case the ideological state and preparedness of a person concerned should be taken into account in the work with people. Judging people with their present life as the focus is the criterion and principle our Party consistently maintains in judging people. All Party organizations, Party workers and officials in the law-enforcement organs should be clearly aware of the Party’s intention and conduct the work with people with prudence so as to further consolidate the single-hearted unity between the Party and the masses. By efficiently working with young people, we should ensure that they stoutly carry forward the tradition of single-hearted unity. Young people, together with the Party and the army, constitute the core of our revolution. As work with young people is important in the revolution and construction, I have attached importance to the youth movement and directed my efforts to work with them from my early days of leading our revolution. The youth problem in our country has already been solved brilliantly. This is a source of great pride for our Party and our people. Young people, who are as faithful to the Party and the revolution as our young people are, cannot be found in any other country. As I say now and then, our young people are laudable, indeed. The Pyongyang-Nampho motorway project is now being 5 implemented by young people. They are following the Party in the van of the forced march when everything is in difficulty. I have watched a video recording of the motorway they laid last year in the face of great difficulties. It was impressive. We should set up a monument to these laudable young builders. It is my intention to give prominence to young people and have their achievements and feats handed down to posterity by setting up a monument to them in the era of the Workers’ Party. In order to ensure that our young people carry forward the tradition of single-hearted unity, we should prepare them more stoutly as successors to the revolutionary cause of Juche. Education in faithfulness should be intensified among them, so that they can become eternal companions of the Party, who trust and follow only our Party in any adversity. Revolutionary and class education should also be intensified among them so as to ensure that they acquire a high revolutionary and class consciousness, and fight to the end against the imperialists and class enemies. At present, they do not know as much as they should about the past of their parents. They should be made to know who a “flower girl” was and what the “sea of blood” was. We should see to it that the whole Party, the entire army and all the people support the Party’s Songun-based leadership faithfully. We started our revolution by means of arms, and we have achieved the liberation of the country, defeated the US imperialist aggressors and safeguarded the dignity and sovereignty of the country by force of arms. To safeguard our socialism and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche by force of arms is an invariable expression of the faith and will of our Party. As long as the imperialists exist on the earth and their aggressive moves continue, attaching importance to arms, to military affairs, is the most important of our national endeavours and a strategic line we should hold fast to all the time. The line of giving importance to military affairs is the most reasonable line for defending and accomplishing the cause of socialism. 6 That the defence lines of the country have been consolidated so as to be impregnable and a fresh turn effected in economic construction in recent years, when the enemy’s schemes against our country grew ever more vicious, is a fruition of the line of attaching importance to military affairs. It is only when we attach importance to arms that we can assure the attaching of importance to ideology, build our country into an economic giant, and provide our people with an independent, creative and happy life. As I have stressed more than once, we can live without candy, but not without arms. Attaching importance to arms is purely and simply Songun-based leadership. We must strengthen the People’s Army on the absolute principle of Songun-based leadership. If the army is weak, we can neither defend the achievements of the revolution nor maintain the existence of the Party itself. President Kim Il Sung created our Songun politics long ago with an eye to the distant future. I took hold of the army and have administered Songun politics true to his intention, thus frustrating the imperialist schemes to suffocate our Republic and safeguarding our socialist system and the destiny of our country and nation in the most trying period of the Arduous March and forced march. The experience of the practical struggle clearly shows that our Songun politics is the most powerful and correct mode of politics. As long as our Party attaches importance to arms and administers Songun politics, our country will be firm. We should hold fast to the idea of giving importance to arms and administer Songun politics in the future, too, and thus build a great, prosperous and powerful country on this land, and realize the reunification of the country, our nation’s cherished wish. The Organizational Leadership Department, the Information and Publicity Department and other departments of the Party committees at all levels, together with the Party workers, should concentrate the spearhead of Party work on applying to the letter the idea of giving importance to arms in support of Songun politics. We should continue to direct great efforts to further strengthening 7 the People’s Army as the army of the Party and the leader. That the army is the army of the Party means, in essence, that it is the army of the leader. Our People’s Army was founded by President Kim Il Sung in the flames of the arduous anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and led by him. It has been developed into an invincible army by our Party. It is the army of the Party and the leader founded and led by President Kim Il Sung in person, and the army of the Supreme Commander. The Supreme Commander’s leadership is the lifeline of the People’s Army. A source of the invincibility and might of the People’s Army is in the Supreme Commander’s leadership. All the officers and men of the People’s Army, always remembering that theirs is the army of the leader and the Supreme Commander, should give the fullest play to the spirit of defending the leadership of the revolution unto death. As the enemy has been scheming recently to undermine our People’s Army from within, all servicepersons should remain vigilant, establish strong military discipline, and make the defence lines of the country as impenetrable as a wall of steel. A revolutionary military climate, in which the entire army obeys the Supreme Commander’s orders without question and moves as one accordingly, should be established in the People’s Army. The Supreme Commander’s orders reflect the demands of the country and revolution, and the aspirations and will of the people. The servicepersons should cross mountains however rugged and steep they are if they are ordered to do so by the Supreme Commander, and regard it as an honour to dedicate their lives on the road of the revolution. The army, in which the Supreme Commander and his men have formed an integral whole, has no match in the world and no fortress it cannot conquer. Today it has perfected an excellent trait of carrying out the Supreme Commander’s orders unto death within itself; I think very highly of this. The People’s Army, as the main force of the revolution, must carry out its Supreme Commander’s orders unconditionally both in peacetime and wartime. The fine traditional trait of unity between the army and the people should be given the fullest play. Unity between the army and the 8 people is a source of the might of our People’s Army and a guarantee of its victory in the fight against any enemy. Unity between the army and the people is all the more urgent in modern warfare, which is fought both at the front and in the rear. The enemy are most afraid of our unity between the army and the people, a powerful weapon for us. Our people, in support of Songun politics, are taking loving care of the soldiers as they would do their own kith and kin, and helping them with all sincerity. The people’s livelihood is not affluent yet, but the spirit of supporting the army is high. All the Party organizations should establish a thoroughgoing spirit of supporting the army, and ensure that all the people hold the soldiers in high esteem and help them both materially and spiritually. The more the entire Party and all the people help it, true to the Party’s idea of attaching importance to military affairs, the more the People’s Army should accelerate its transformation on revolutionary lines, so that it can demonstrate more highly the noble features of the revolutionary army. The soldiers must never rest on their laurels or indulge in bravado on the grounds that they are supported and helped by the civilians. If the soldiers, defenders of the country and the nation, indulge in bravado, it may invite disaster. To rest on one’s laurels or to indulge in bravado is a taboo for the soldiers. The People’s Army should educate all the soldiers to be faithful to the Party and their Supreme Commander, and to bear bitter hatred against the US imperialists, the Japanese reactionaries and all other class enemies so that they are firmly resolved to become human bullets and deal merciless blows to the enemy should they invade so much as an inch of our sacred land, sky or waters. The soldiers should not think that they are duty-bound to receive the people’s sincere help; the more the people treasure them, love them and help them, the more they in turn should love the people and the more they should treasure the people’s interests and their lives and property, always defending them even at the cost of their own lives. In order to further consolidate the defence capabilities of the country and make them impregnable, we should continue to channel 9 great efforts to the defence industry as well. Party organizations should pay deep attention to the defence industry to lead the officials and workers in this sector to discharge their tasks sincerely and with a high sense of responsibility and enthusiasm. We should give substantial Party guidance to the economic work to bring about a fresh upsurge in building our country into an economic giant. Our country can be said to have already attained the status of an ideological and military power. With the rapid development of socialist art and literature, model works of socialist art and literature were created and a revolutionary turn was made in the building of overall socialist art and literature in the past. So our country can be said to have become a power in the building of culture, too. In recent years, many world-class athletes have been produced, including a world women’s marathon champion, accelerating the country’s advance toward becoming a sports power. If we solve our economic problems, too, we will be able to accomplish the cause of building a great, prosperous and powerful country since our politico-ideological position and military strength have been made rock-solid. We should carry out the Party’s economic policy so as to bring about a fresh upsurge in this year’s economic work. The Party’s economic policy is a militant banner we should hold high in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country. What is important in carrying out the Party’s economic policy is to make the existing independent national economy pay off. This year we should direct our primary effort to the electric-power and coal-mining industries, the most important fronts in the socialist economic construction, so as to radically increase the production of electricity and coal. Rail transport, and the metals and machinebuilding industries should be shored up at an early date, and a revolution should be made in light industry as well to solve the problem of consumer goods. We should pay continuous attention to the agricultural sector to solve the food problem. We should decisively increase the output of 10 grains by thoroughly applying the Juche farming method, effecting a revolution in seed production and forcefully pushing ahead with potato farming and double-cropping, and at the same time solve the meat problem as soon as possible by undertaking stockbreeding and fish farming in a bold and expansive way. Party organizations should continue with grand nature-remaking projects, like land realignment and land development, improving roads and rivers and planting trees. They should also ensure that all sectors and units stress the establishment of a cultured environment for living and production as befits socialist ones so as to effect a fresh turn in this regard. In order to bring about a fresh upsurge in this year’s effort for the building of our country into an economic giant, we should pay great attention to the development of science and technology. Science and technology constitute one of the three pillars of the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country. It is only when we develop science and technology that we can reactivate the country’s economy at the earliest date possible and increase production without letup by replacing backward technologies with advanced ones. Technological upgrading of the national economy also demands that science and technology be developed. The role of scientists and technicians should be enhanced. Party organizations should establish a climate of attaching importance to science and technology throughout society, give prominence to all the scientists and technicians, and provide them with good conditions for living and working. Scientists and technicians should strengthen creative cooperation with workers and introduce their successful research results into production and construction, so as to do their bit in the stepping up of the grand Chollima march. All the scientists and technicians should raise the country’s science and technology to the world standard by directing their efforts to the development of basic as well as cutting-edge science branches in conformity with the trend of development of science and technology. Party organizations and Party workers should decisively eliminate 11 the practice of intruding into the fields of the administrative officials or taking over administrative affairs themselves, and give Party-based support to the leading economic officials so that they can conduct economic work with full responsibility. Economic executives should organize and command economic work efficiently, as required by the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country. They should see to it that all sectors and units manage and administer the economy on the principle of assuring profits. Officials of the Cabinet, commissions, ministries and other economic guidance organs should study hard how to lower costs and the amount of raw materials consumed per unit of product and increase labour efficiency, while ensuring that even if only one product were to be made, it would be made in an excellent way for its end user. Economical practices should be encouraged, and wasteful practices eliminated. Economy means production. Economy in socialist society is not an undertaking for an individual, but for society, the community and the person concerned. Now there are many things we use wastefully. We should eliminate various forms of wasteful practices, and make economical use of electricity, cement, coal and oil, clearly aware that they are a treasure secured by the sweat of the brows of the people. Attention should be directed to eliminating non-productive spending. We should push ahead with the effort to establish the Juche orientation and apply the national character to the revolution and construction. This has become more urgent than ever before in view of the present situation at home and abroad. If we are to frustrate the isolateand-stifle schemes of the imperialists and reactionaries, which are growing more vicious, and defend socialism to the last, we should preserve the Juche character and the national character. This is why I presented a few years ago a paper in which I emphasized the need to preserve the Juche character and the national character of the revolution and construction. However, we can still find in several 12 sectors of social life remnants of sycophancy, which are alien to us. As we have now entered a new millennium, we should review in a comprehensive way the past outdated patterns and conventions of the style of other countries, and develop all work in our own fashion. Party organizations should decisively enhance their functions and roles. Whenever I inspect army units, I find that Party political work is being done efficiently in the army. Party organizations in society should learn from the experience of Party political work in the army. In enhancing the functions and roles of Party organizations, how their organizational and information and publicity departments work is important. Clearly aware of their positions, the departments should work responsibly as intended by the Party. The organizational department should direct its efforts to the organizational work of the Party, and the information and publicity department should efficiently conduct ideological work by holding fast to the Party’s line of attaching importance to ideology. Regarding ideology as the main thing and accomplishing the revolution and construction on the strength of ideology is a consistent policy of our Party. Our Party stressed already in the early 1970s that all should equip themselves with the Party’s ideas and theories, and become standard-bearers in implementing the Party’s policies. The information and publicity department should imbue the whole society with the spirit of defending the leadership of the revolution unto death by carrying out the Party’s policy of attaching importance to ideology. They should eliminate formalism in ideological work, and conduct all types of edification in a realistic and fresh way in conformity with the requirements of the actual situation. Party officials should acquire qualifications and traits proper to them, and work responsibly. Party officials should become men of ability. Unless their intense faithfulness is supported by real ability, they cannot efficiently conduct complicated Party work, that is, work with people. Party officials should be exemplary in working by virtue of real ability. 13 Holding aloft the slogan “Let us support the Party by virtue of real ability!” Party officials should incessantly improve their political and business qualifications. They should study in depth the Party’s ideas and theories and the practice of Party work by establishing a revolutionary way of studying, and apply them in their work. Party officials should be principled and fair in their work. If they make concessions or take a one-sided view with regard to problems out of tender-heartedness or material relationships, they may bring about a great loss for the Party. They should always maintain Party principles at and outside work, and deal with all problems arising in a fair manner. Party officials should not stand on ceremony. Even though they lack something, they should continue to live and work without it, and if they do not know something, they should say frankly that they do not know it. They should be sincere in their work and life, and never show partiality in their relationship with people. Party officials should work devotedly for the people. Only those who are ready to sacrifice their own lives for the people’s benefit and share life and death with them can become true Party officials. Treading a thorny path on their own and making people enjoy happiness and glory–this should be their ennobling trait. Party officials should live and work cheerfully, always filled with confidence. The harder the conditions are, the more necessary a cheerful life is. Party officials should embody the slogan “Let us go the thorny path cheerfully!” in their work and life, and thus always live and work cheerfully. Party officials should know how to motivate people, and be full of affection. They should know how to touch people’s heartstrings through speeches, and dance and sing with them. Senior officials should be exemplary in leading a cultured life on holidays and offdays; only then will their subordinates be able to rest and lead a cultural life to their heart’s content on those days. For the immediate period ahead, Party organizations should conduct organizational and political work down to the minutest detail 14 to ensure that all sectors and units are enthusiastic about the struggle to greet the 55th anniversary of the Party’s founding as a grand festival of victors. I am going to have a letter and appeal issued to all the members in the name of the Party Central Committee on the occasion of the anniversary, so that the Party members and other working people will know clearly the Party’s intention and turn out as one in the struggle for greeting the anniversary as a grand festival of victors.",today greet new fill hope last change party entire army rise

27.03.2000,Kim Jong Il,"Ryanggang Province is a historic place with many relics associated with our revolution. Ubiquitous in the province are the revolutionary battle sites and historic sites of the days of the antiJapanese armed struggle, like the Paektusan Secret Camp and other camps and bivouacs, and the sites of the battles of Pochonbo and the Musan area and other battles. In Kim Jong Suk County and Kim Hyong Jik County along the Amnok River in the province are relics associated with the revolutionary activities of Kim Jong Suk and Kim Hyong Jik, respectively. Also there are tombs of many revolutionaries, who had fought in the homeland before being executed at the time of the Hyesan incident, and other patriots. The whole province can be called a grand open-air museum exhibiting revolutionary treasures important in education in the revolutionary traditions. The area of Mt Paektu in Ryanggang Province is a sacred place of the revolution in which relics associated with President Kim Il Sung’s revolutionary activities in the days of the anti-Japanese armed struggle 28 are situated in a concentrated way. It is thus an important base for education in the revolutionary traditions. The area not only has many such relics, but is associated with the lofty intention of the President, who made efforts to turn it into a base for education in the revolutionary traditions. True to his lofty intention, our Party paid close attention to laying out the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt Paektu in the past and gave energetic guidance to this project. As a result, the battle sites have been laid out as a grand open-air museum, an authoritative base for education in the revolutionary traditions in the excellent way we see today. A thoroughgoing system has been established for their eternal preservation. The revolutionary relics in our country witnessed a turn for the better in their administration after our Party had begun to guide it under its direct charge. In the 1970s the work of unearthing and identifying revolutionary battle sites and historic sites was conducted on a large scale; many of them were laid out in those days. Under our Party’s leadership there have been established in our country a system of managing the revolutionary relics, a system of academic research into them and a system of educating guides for the sites. No other country in the world, I’m sure, has such well-regulated systems. This is a source of pride to all of us. During the current inspection of the area of Mt Paektu I looked round the Paektusan and Sajabong secret camps, Chongbong, Pegaebong, Konchang and Mupho bivouacs, Grand Samjiyon Monument, and Sinsadong and Taehongdan revolutionary battle sites. I am visiting the Paektusan Secret Camp after a long interval. The snowscape of the camp is spectacular. The monument inscribed with a poem in President Kim Il Sung’s own handwriting and standing by my birthplace at the secret camp looks refined. I think it is the best of all the monuments I have seen so far. It impresses me very much. The President’s style of handwriting is quite unique. The more I see it, the more I feel it is the best style of handwriting. The monument is set up at a suitable place, and as the letters etched on the monument have 29 not been painted, it looks weightier. If the letters etched on the monuments to the President’s revolutionary activities and his on-thespot instructions are painted in golden or red colour, the monuments may look neither natural nor refined. It will be advisable not to paint in colour the letters on such monuments to be set up in the future if the inscriptions are to be as short as that on the monument inscribed with a poem written by the President. If the inscription is long and if it is not coloured, it will be difficult to distinguish the letters. The letters on the monument etched 2 cm deep will not be weathered even after the lapse of a long time. You say that President Kim Il Sung, posing for a photograph with the female guides in front of the monument in August 1993, said, “I am posing for a souvenir photograph with you with a wish that you will support Comrade Kim Jong Il well. This is a request I make of you.” His words were quite moving. It is good that students say that they were determined to contribute to the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country by studying harder, after seeing the slogan “Let us all learn. Knowledge is more powerful than gold,” hanging on a wall of the barracks at the Paektusan Secret Camp. The Grand Samjiyon Monument is certainly a masterpiece. The bronze statue of President Kim Il Sung at the monument is portrayed well. When the Mansudae Art Studio was casting the statue, I went to the studio and guided the casting in person. The large-sized granite statue Bugler of the Advance is also portrayed well. The bugler looks like he is dashing forward blowing the bugle. The statue is a worldclass national treasure. The Pegaebong Bivouac is the place where President Kim Il Sung, during the anti-Japanese armed struggle, put forward the tactical line of advancing to the area of Mt Roun by marching along the Kapsan-Musan guard road in broad daylight employing the tactic of marching 1 000 ri at a stretch, so as to annihilate the enemy soldiers in the area and conduct political work among the local people. The larches growing around the bivouac are all upright and impressive. The Mupho Bivouac is a scenic place. You say that people 30 interpret its name to mean a place containing immortal revolutionary exploits and ennobling aim. This interpretation is plausible. I once came to Mupho for angling. I still remember how I racked my brains as I fished on how to formulate President Kim Il Sung’s revolutionary ideology. The place across the river is Helong, China, and to its northwest is Antu, also in China. Antu is a historic place where President Kim Il Sung organized the KPRA (Korean People’s Revolutionary Army). Kang Pan Sok, President Kim Il Sung’s mother, was entombed there first. Measures for preserving the revolutionary battle sites and historic sites in the area of Mt Paektu were taken well, and they have been taken good care of. Modern lightning conductors were set up in two places at the Chongbong Bivouac for its protection from lightning. You have done a good job of this. The measures taken to preserve the slogan-bearing trees at the bivouac, including shades to be raised and lowered automatically around them, were carried out well. As these scientific and technological measures have been taken, the letters of the slogans written by my mother Kim Jong Suk, and other slogans are still vivid. I have heard that a journalist from south Korea, after looking round the bivouac, said that he realized clearly how great is the attention the north pays to preserving the revolutionary relics. He was right to say so. The devices for preserving eternally the slogan-bearing trees at the Sajabong Secret Camp are also good. Among them are slogans which reflect life, like “I won’t forget my mother’s request that I see her again after defeating the Japs without fail, request she made when I was taking leave of my native home,” “I won’t forget my dear sister, who said, embracing me when I was taking leave of my native home, that I must return home after defeating the Japs without fail,” and “I won’t forget the promise I made to my sweetheart in my native village that I’ll return home after defeating the Japs without fail.” These slogans vividly show the revolutionary optimistic spirit of the soldiers of the KPRA. While looking at these slogans, President 31 Kim Il Sung said that the soldiers of the KPRA were able to emerge victorious in the arduous struggle because they had lived in an optimistic way. He was right; the more difficult the situation is, the more optimistically a revolutionary should live. The barracks and the structure where the printing shop was situated in this secret camp are covered in glass for their eternal preservation. This was well done. The stationery, mimeograph machine and other relics formerly used by the printing shop workers and displayed in the printing shop look lifelike. You noted that the guerrillas built the chimney of the printing shop low to ensure that the smoke from it would go unnoticed in the forest. It is good that the paths in the secret camps and bivouacs were paved with wooden blocks. The yard in front of my birthplace and the road leading to the log cabin of the Headquarters in the Paektusan Secret Camp and the paths in the Chongbong and Konchang bivouacs, all paved with wooden blocks, look good. You say that President Kim Il Sung noted, after seeing the paths in the Chongbong Bivouac, that they match the surrounding environment. They certainly match the landscape of the surrounding area. Paths paved with wooden blocks are better than those paved with pumiceous sand, weathered gneiss or cement. The areas surrounding the revolutionary battle sites have been kept clean. The log cabin of the Headquarters, my birthplace and the barracks have been preserved so well and their surroundings kept so clean that they are impressive. The guides and caretakers of the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt Paektu must have taken much trouble to perform their duties sincerely in the rigorous natural environment here. It is laudable that the guides, though they could wear smart clothes if they were living in town, are guiding the visitors responsibly wearing simple uniforms while managing their life on their own in the primeval forest without any complaint. Among the guides are ones who have served as guides for many years, and sister guides as well. The guides, whom I met during this visit, are impressive. The most impressive one is the guide of the 32 Sinsadong Revolutionary Battle Site. While looking round the battle site, I stopped at the well from where my mother Kim Jong Suk drew water when she went there in May 1939; the guide explained the relics very well, with composure and in a refined voice. I was told that she had worked as a guide for 22 years after graduating from Kim Jong Suk University of Education, and her husband also works in the administration sector of revolutionary relics. It is a good thing that the couple has worked together for a long time in this sector. I was also told that at the battle site there is a guide who has worked as one for 18 years. The two, who have worked as guides for 22 and 18 years, respectively, are veteran guides. I had been apprehensive that the guides of the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt Paektu might lead a lonely life in the remote forest. But now that I have seen them living optimistically organizing a cultural and emotional life, I feel at ease. During my current inspection of the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt Paektu, I have felt afresh many impressive things. I once again felt keenly how hard it must have been for President Kim Il Sung to fight fierce battles with the enemy while eating and sleeping in the open and make challenging marches while enduring hunger and cold in the days of the anti-Japanese armed struggle, when we find it difficult to simply walk in this area. In addition, I thought more deeply how precious and great were the revolutionary achievements of President Kim Il Sung. The President was a legendary hero, a peerlessly great man, who fought his way across thousands of miles for the liberation of the country and the freedom and happiness of the people. His immortal revolutionary exploits will live in the hearts of our people for ever and shine for ever in history. The anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters wrote an unprecedented history of resistance with blood and sweat by traversing the thorny road of the revolution in support of their Commander Kim Il Sung, and the spirit of defending the leader unto death and the indomitable revolutionary spirit they cherished still pulsate in the hearts of our soldiers and other people. 33 The brilliant traditions created by President Kim Il Sung in the days of the anti-Japanese revolution are a solid foundation and eternal cornerstone of our Party and revolution. To safeguard forever and carry forward these revolutionary traditions and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche on the basis of these traditions is an unshakeable will and determination of our Party. We should intensify education in the revolutionary traditions without letup; this undertaking should be conducted more proactively with the change of generations of the revolution and the deepening of the revolution. My current inspection of the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt Paektu is aimed at creating a social climate of further intensifying education in the revolutionary traditions as required in these days, when the whole Party, the entire army and all the people have turned out for the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country. Our Party took measures for intensifying this education as early as in the 1960s, and ensured that the whole society joined the grand Chollima upsurge in socialist construction by learning from the revolutionary spirit and way of work and living of the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners. Decades have passed since then, a change of generations has taken place, and the young people of those days have now become the basic force of the revolution and construction, and our revolution has advanced to the high stage of building a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country. This historical fact urgently demands that we further intensify education in the revolutionary traditions among our people. The situation of our revolution at home and abroad is as complicated and acute as ever. Trials severer than those at present may crop up on the road of our revolution. Then we may have to follow a road as thorny as that President Kim Il Sung followed in the days of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. If we are to surmount all the difficulties facing the revolution we must intensify education in the revolutionary traditions among the Party members and other working people. 34 Intensifying this type of education is also important in view of the historical lessons of the world socialist movement. Several parties which had been building socialism in the past gave up education in the revolutionary traditions, making a mess of the revolutionary gains their revolutionary predecessors had achieved at the cost of blood and disrupting their socialist systems in the end. We should further intensify education in the revolutionary traditions more than ever before, and thus show the whole world that we are advancing holding aloft the red flag of the revolution as ever. We should continue to direct great efforts to this undertaking to ensure that all the Party members and other working people live and work as the anti-Japanese guerrillas did, holding high the slogan “Let us produce, study and live like the anti-Japanese guerrillas!” and accomplish through generations the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered by President Kim Il Sung. Education in the revolutionary traditions should be conducted in various forms and by various methods. Education through revolutionary battle sites and historic sites is an effective method of education in the revolutionary traditions. In equipping the Party members and other working people with the revolutionary traditions, it is important to organize actively and down to the minutest detail education through the revolutionary battle sites and historic sites in the area of Mt Paektu. Our revolution is rooted in Mt Paektu, and the spirit of Korea is the very spirit of Mt Paektu. In order to proactively conduct education through the revolutionary battle sites and historic sites in this area study tours to the mountain should be organized on a wide scale. Only when they have climbed the mountain and visited the Paektusan Secret Camp will people know more clearly the history and root of our revolution and the imperishable revolutionary exploits of President Kim Il Sung, and appreciate more deeply the revolutionary spirit of Mt Paektu. The People’s Army frequently organizes study tours to the area of Mt Paektu, including the Paektusan Secret Camp, but it is not the same case with the civilians. The youth league units organize such tours for youth and students, but only on the occasion of national 35 holidays or anniversary days, not on a regular footing. When such tours are organized, only a meeting to bolster determination is held at a battle site. If study tours are organized in this way, education in the revolutionary traditions cannot be substantial. The form of study tours is not important. Study tours to the revolutionary battle sites should be organized with the main emphasis on learning President Kim Il Sung’s revolutionary ideas, the revolutionary spirit of Mt Paektu, and the way of fighting and living of the anti-Japanese guerrillas. This should be done in a purposeful and regular way. This will make the Party members, other working people, soldiers, youth and students arm themselves more firmly with the revolutionary traditions of our Party. For study tours to the revolutionary battle sites and historic sites to be organized on a regular footing, conditions for transportation should be provided. The greatest problem for study tours to the revolutionary battle sites in Ryanggang Province, those in the area of Mt Paektu in particular, is transportation. Tourists, after arriving at Hyesan, the seat of the province, find it difficult to tour the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt Paektu because of this problem. It will be ideal for solving this problem to enable the train that arrives at Hyesan to continue, making a round of the revolutionary battle sites and historic sites in the area of Mt Paektu. As these places are not far from Hyesan, we can do this fairly easily. The roads between Hyesan and these places are fairly good, so the problem of transporting tourists can be solved to a considerable extent if good buses are provided. If transportation is strained, young people and students could be encouraged to tour the places on foot. Supply services for the tourists are important, too. Potatoes produced by the Phothae Combined Farm should be made available for the tourists. If potatoes are stored along the tour routes and the tourists are encouraged to roast potatoes themselves to eat or are served with various foods made from potatoes, like pancakes or starch noodles on their tours, they will be pleased with these special foods they cannot eat elsewhere. In the future the Phothae Combined Farm may be turned into a farm that specializes in serving tourists. 36 We should put efforts into the proper laying out, preserving and managing of the revolutionary battle sites and historic sites in Ryanggang Province, eternal treasures of our revolution, particularly of those in the area of Mt Paektu. During my current inspection of the revolutionary battle sites and historic sites I was resolved to lay them out to be perfect even in the distant future, and gave the relevant tasks to those concerned. As we have entered a new millennium, we should approach things from a fresh point of view, putting to rights what have to be put to rights and laying out again what have to be laid out again. The revolutionary battle sites and historic sites should be preserved so that people can see their original appearance vividly, and taken good care of. Even during the arduous struggle the antiJapanese guerrillas laid out their camping site cleanly and kept the surrounding areas in good order, setting up latrines even if they were to stay there only one night. The log cabin of the Headquarters, my birthplace and the barracks at the Paektusan Secret Camp should be kept in the way the anti-Japanese guerrillas lived there. Then the guides will be able to explain the relics to the tourists in relation to the anti-Japanese guerrillas’ way of living. It is necessary to well preserve and take good care of the sloganbearing trees at the revolutionary battle sites, and study methods of education through the slogans. When I was looking round the Rangnim Revolutionary Museum in Jagang Province last autumn I saw bits of trees bearing slogans displayed in a row in the museum. Slogan-bearing trees which are located in places difficult of access can be brought to one place and preserved in that way. In this case, they should not be displayed without any purpose, but for academic significance and educational purposes. What is most important in preserving and administering the revolutionary battle sites and historic sites is to take measures for preventing forest fires. Ryanggang Province is a province at the level of a national treasure. Most of the revolutionary battle sites and historic sites in the province are 37 located in dense forests; if the leaves of the trees pile up in the forests in autumn, then they are equivalent to piles of explosives. This is why it is difficult to put out a forest fire once it starts. If the revolutionary battle sites and historic sites catch fire we may lose priceless assets and treasures of the country. If the revolutionary battle sites and historic sites in the area of Mt Paektu, which are associated with President Kim Il Sung’s revolutionary activities, catch fire, the consequence cannot be made up for even with heaps of gold. The province should pay particular attention to taking measures for preventing forest fires. Automatic devices are said to have been set up for protecting the Chongbong Bivouac from fire, but if it catches fire, the blaze may spin out of control. We should be watchful against forest fires; firebreaks at all the revolutionary battle sites should be reinforced, possible sources of fire should be detected and eliminated, and people should be stopped from wandering in the forests aimlessly while carrying inflammable substances. As the majority of the inhabitants of Samjiyon County are now engaged in the administration of the revolutionary relics, the county should hold fast to the work of preserving and administering the revolutionary battle sites as their main task. For education in the revolutionary traditions through the revolutionary battle sites and historic sites to be intensified, the ranks of guides should be built up and their role enhanced. The ranks of guides of the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt Paektu should be built up well. It would be advisable to select excellent graduates of universities of education across the country and appoint them as guides at these places after about one year of internship. Guides of the revolutionary battle sites should be efficient in explaining the stories associated with the sites. When I was visiting the Yonphung Revolutionary Museum in Jagang Province last year, the guide gave me a vivid and composed explanation; she even sang a revolutionary song. The guides of the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt Paektu should improve their presentation. Guides and caretakers of the revolutionary battle sites should 38 improve their level of cultural and emotional life. This time I watched an amateur artistic performance staged by the guides and caretakers of the Paektusan Secret Camp. They should be shown the artistic performance of the amateur art squad of a unit of the army; then they would be able to stage excellent artistic pieces. In the future, the units administering revolutionary relics should stage amateur artistic performances on a high level. Guides and caretakers should be provided with good conditions for living. The guides and caretakers of the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt Paektu take much trouble working in deep forests, and so we should provide them with all the things they need. The guides are said to be supplied with cotton-padded shoes in winter; as the weather in the area of Mt Paektu in winter is colder than in other regions, the women will feel their hands and feet cold when they are out of doors for a long time, and may fall ill. So they should keep themselves warm, including their hands and feet. The guides should be provided with fur boots. The guides say they burn wood to cook their food. It will be difficult for them to gather firewood after guiding tourists all day long. In the places which are provided with electricity generated by small- and medium-sized power stations, heaters should be provided for cooking, and the guides’ dormitories should be heated by electricity. Drinking water is scarce in the area of Mt Paektu, and this is a problem for the guides and caretakers there. This problem must be solved. It will not do for the guides and caretakers who look after the revolutionary battle sites to suffer from a shortage of water. I had water purifiers and water heaters sent to them. Then they will be able to drink purified water and take baths in warm water. Cherishing the dignity and honour of working at the meaningful revolutionary battle sites associated with President Kim Il Sung’s revolutionary activities, the officials, guides and caretakers of the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt Paektu should effectively undertake preservation and management of the sites and education in the revolutionary traditions through them.",ryanggang

27.06.2000,Kim Jong Il,"Today I have organized this gathering to meet and talk to you, creative workers and artistes of the Merited Chorus of the Korean People’s Army. Whenever I have an opportunity, I meet you; it is because you create many songs that instill strength into me, and stage artistic performances in a revolutionary fashion as intended by the Party. I feel very pleased when I see the performances staged by the Merited Chorus, pulsating with the vigour and militant cheerfulness of the revolutionary army. Then I feel the fatigue accumulated over several days of working burning the midnight oil vanishing, and fresh strength and courage welling up. In order to arouse the soldiers and other people by means of revolutionary songs, inspiring them with confidence and cheerfulness in the days when the whole country was shedding tears of blood after the death of President Kim Il Sung, I built up the Chorus under the Korean People’s Army Ensemble as an independent, elite art organization, and had it create and stage choruses exclusively. Then, to make it a national-level chorus, I had it render not only songs with 52 military themes but also national masterpieces, like Song of Comradeship, A Soldier’s Wish, The Fighting Road Following the General and We’ll Travel One Road Forever, and had it named the Merited Chorus of the Korean People’s Army. Had it still been under the Korean People’s Army Ensemble, it would not have developed into today’s world-class chorus. We were right to detach the Chorus from the Korean People’s Army Ensemble and develop it as the Merited Chorus of the Korean People’s Army. The name of the art organization of the Korean People’s Army is not clear. The name of a foreign art organization was translated after the liberation of the country, and the translated version was given to the art organization of the Korean People’s Army. It was mistranslated. The correct translation is not “ensemble,” but “song and dance ensemble.” Under the Party’s direct guidance the Merited Chorus has now developed into a world-level first-class chorus. There is no art organization in the world which can match the Merited Chorus in terms of size and standards. We should take due pride in having such a prestigious chorus as the Merited Chorus of the Korean People’s Army. The Merited Chorus is the standard-bearer of the revolution, the bugler of advance, which instilled strength, courage and vigour in the soldiers and other people, as it was always beside me in the most trying and arduous days of our revolution. Our soldiers and other people sang with the Merited Chorus; they changed the sorrow over the death of President Kim Il Sung into strength and courage, and rose up, singing We Pledge; defended our style of socialism, singing Hold High the Red Flag as the second version of Song of the Red Flag; and frustrated all sorts of challenges of the enemy, singing We Will Defend the Leadership of the Revolution at the Cost of Our Lives as the theme song of the Arduous March and forced march. The works the Merited Chorus created and portrayed artistically all reflect the faith and will, and lines and policies of our Party, and call upon us to boldly follow the road of Juche under the Party’s 53 leadership. I feel very satisfied with it, and highly appreciate the brilliant exploits the Merited Chorus has performed for the times and the revolution. I intend to build a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country on this land and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche on the strength of music politics as well as Songun politics. As it has done so far, the Merited Chorus must support our Party’s Songun politics and music politics in the van, and sing louder the songs which the Party wants it to sing, as it holds high as ever the red flag of the revolution in the van of the marching ranks. The creative workers and artistes should train themselves firmly to be the Party’s eternal companion and powerful buglers with a determination that they will share their destiny with me. They should think and behave anytime and anywhere in accordance with the ideas and will of the Supreme Commander, and devote their all for the Supreme Commander. The Merited Chorus must become an ideologically pure entity which is imbued with the Supreme Commander’s revolutionary ideas. To this end, its creative workers and artistes should intensify their organizational and ideological life, and temper themselves in the practical struggle to transform themselves on the revolutionary lines in a thoroughgoing fashion. As I said not long ago, the members of the Merited Chorus should climb Mt Paektu to have a taste of a snowstorm and see the spectacular sunrise, and visit my birthplace in the Paektusan Secret Camp and Jong Il Peak while camping in the open. Only then can they nurture the faith and will to accomplish, cherishing the soul of Paektu, the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered on the mountain, and temper body and mind in the meantime. Rodong Sinmun carried an impressive editorial, titled, The Snowstorm of Mt Paektu, following one titled, The Songs of the Revolutionary Army Fire Our Hearts. The writer wrote the former editorial after having first-hand experience of a snowstorm on Mt Paektu. In the past I took the Merited Chorus with me when I was 54 inspecting the army units, including those on the front line and islets, and visiting various places, including Jagang Province, because I wanted to have its creative workers and artistes witness how the soldiers and other people were working and learn from their high ideological and mental world and way of fighting. You cannot feel the vibrant atmosphere of our times when death-defying struggles are being waged, nor create revolutionary and militant artistic works that can contribute to the revolutionary struggle if you pursue comfort in a well-heated room. When you go to the field, you can hear everywhere stories about those who dedicated their all for the sake of the Party and the leader–a story about Hero Kim Kwang Chol when you go to a frontline post and a story about Hero Kil Yong Jo when you go to Wonsan, for example. The creative workers and artistes of the Merited Chorus should learn from the ennobling mental world of the faithful people of our times, and strive to work and live like them. In future I am going to send the Merited Chorus to Taehongdan so that it can stage a performance by the fields full of potato blossoms. For that purpose, it should prepare loudspeakers. The loudspeakers to be used during the performance tour should be tested at a performance, perhaps on Mirim Plain. The Merited Chorus should further improve its level of artistic representation. At the moment the volume of the Chorus is rich and it makes a great ensemble; its weak point is that its sound is not wide enough. In order to widen its sound, the Chorus should solve the problem of special tenor and special bass. In the past, the current conductor of the Mansudae Art Troup was the best tenor in our country’s vocal music, and the singer who played the landlord in the revolutionary opera The Flower Girl was the best bass. The Merited Chorus should have singers who can sing tenor and bass like them. You say four to five singers who can sing special tenor and special bass, respectively, are being trained. The Merited Chorus should train them well so as to solve the problem of the width of sound without fail. It is good that the Merited Chorus is making effective use of the 55 Collection of Unaccompanied Choruses for Basic Chorus Training I sent it. As the book is good for chorus training, other art organizations want the book as well. If the book is used properly, it will prove considerably helpful for solving the problems of interval and balancing vocal parts. I will send the Merited Chorus a fresh edition of the book, whose contents I have supplemented. The Merited Chorus of the Korean People’s Army should make proper preparations for staging performances for foreign heads of state and performance tours abroad. In particular, it should select the repertoire properly. When they are staging artistic performances abroad, art organizations should pay special attention to preserving the national character. Some art organizations include synthesizers and other electronic instruments in the orchestra, leading to improper preservation of the advantages of our traditional instruments. I am going to have them include a three-woodwind orchestra in their performance tours abroad. Such an orchestra will demonstrate to the world the level of development of our Juche-based national music. The creative force of the Merited Chorus of the Korean People’s Army should be built up. At the end of last year the Chorus created and staged the chorus We Will Never Forget. This song is the best of the songs created in recent years, portraying the struggle of our Party in its leadership of the Arduous March. If the Merited Chorus is to produce excellent works in a greater number in future, too, it should build up its creative force. The head of the Creation Department and the head of the Lyrics Creation Room of the Korean People’s Army Ensemble should be appointed to the Merited Chorus of the Korean People’s Army, as they have made great achievements in the creation of lyrics. If they are assigned to the Merited Chorus they can create lyrics for the Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble as well as for the Merited Chorus itself. There has been no distinct development in the dance of the Korean People’s Army Ensemble. It has not produced dance pieces worth mentioning so far after staging My Heavy Machine Gun. When seen 56 from the present point of view, that dance piece has the tendency of affectation in artistic portrayal. The Korean People’s Army Ensemble should take measures to develop dance further. I will have the problems raised by the Merited Chorus of the Korean People’s Army solved as top priority. Nothing should be spared if it is for the Merited Chorus. The long-serving creative workers and artistes should be valued and taken good care of. Particular attention should be paid to their health. Loved by the people, they are treasures and assets of the country. Whenever there arise problems concerning their health, I feel so heart-broken that I can hardly sleep. Aged artistes should not be demobilized at random. Though aged, one can fully perform artistic activities if one is healthy and highly skilled. If veteran singers, their breasts ablaze with decorations, sing shoulder to shoulder on the stage, it will demonstrate that the Merited Chorus has a long and dignified history. The prospects for the Merited Chorus are bright. Most of its commanding personnel and renowned creative workers and artistes are in their fifties, which can be called their golden years. The Merited Chorus should hold a reunification concert on a grand scale on Mt Halla on the day the country is reunified. I wish you every success in your artistic creative work and performance activities to expedite the coming of that day.",today organize gathering meet talk creative worker artiste merit chorus army

03.01.2001,Kim Jong Il,"We rang out the 20th century, and have rung in the 21st century. The year 2000 was a year when stirring events unprecedented in the history of our country took place and great victories were achieved. In response to the Party’s militant appeal to glorify the year that marked the 55th anniversary of Party founding as a year of proud victory in the flames of the great Chollima upsurge, the whole Party, the entire army and all the people turned out as one with an indefatigable will, making a fresh advance in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country, and bringing about an epochal turn in the effort for national reunification. Our Party and people brought the trying Arduous March to a victorious conclusion and adorned the last year of the 20th century with flying colours. Rarely have there been times when we demonstrated the dignity and honour of our country like last year. As I look back on the past century at the threshold of a new century, the yearning for President Kim Il Sung grows all the more poignant. It was because they had him that our people could demonstrate to the whole world the dignity and honour of their nation in the 20th century. There were no statesmen in the 20th century who 73 performed exploits as great as those performed by President Kim Il Sung. He was a preeminent man representing the 20th century. His ideas and exploits will inspire our people and other progressive people all over the world to a victorious struggle in the new century, too. Our cause is the revolutionary cause of Juche, and the road we are following is the road of Juche pioneered by President Kim Il Sung. The road of Juche is assured of victory, and the name of Kim Il Sung represents the eternal banner of victory. We will be greeting President Kim Il Sung’s 90th birth anniversary next year. We must add eternal glory to the imperishable exploits he performed by devoting his all to the country and the people throughout his life, and realize his lifetime wishes without fail. His greatest wishes were to enable our people to lead a happy life envied by others and to reunify the country. He found all his pleasure and comfort in bringing happiness to his people. In order to provide our people with an abundant and cultured life envied by others, he devoted all his efforts to giving field guidance till the last days of his life. He was so concerned with the people’s living that he once said to officials who were wishing him a long life in good health, that he would live 100 years if our people lived envying nothing in the world as they lived in excellent houses eating good food and wearing fine clothes. We must bring this earnest wish of his to reality as soon as possible. Over the past few years we have undertaken grand-scale nature-remaking projects, like land realigning, and set up many monumental structures that serve the people, like factories, despite the difficulties of the Arduous March and forced march. Yet, we still have many problems to solve if we are to realize President Kim Il Sung’s wishes. The greatest problem for the people at the moment is that of food. I feel most chagrined to have failed to provide enough food for the people who trusted and followed the Party faithfully in the most trying days. It will not do for us to fail to solve the food problem in the new century, too. We must solve the food problem first by all means. First of all, we should decisively increase grain production and 74 provide the people with food grain on a regular basis by farming well. We have imported food grains from other countries in recent years because of poor farming. We cannot continue to import food grains, as by this method we cannot stabilize the people’s livelihood. The entire Party, the whole country and all the people should strive for bumper harvests in the first year of the new century. All the cooperative farms, conscious of being responsible for the supply of food grains to the nation, should raise the unit-area yield by performing all types of farm work, ranging from making preparations, sowing and seedling transplanting to weeding, as required by the Juche farming method. The state should supply the countryside with oil fuel, fertilizer and electricity in time and in sufficient quantities. We should consistently keep up with the policies of making a revolution in seed breeding and potato production, and engage widely in double-cropping with the main emphasis on cultivating cereal crops as the first and second crops. The Taehongdan County Combined Farm did a good job of potato farming last year; it should continue to increase potato yields without letup. We should continue to push forward with land realigning, and complete the project at an early date. Land realigning will enable us to increase the land under cultivation, free the farmers from backbreaking labour by realizing comprehensive mechanization of the rural economy, and increase grain production. We have performed nature-transformation feats by realigning the fields in Kangwon, North Phyongan and South Hwanghae provinces over the past few years. We should now realign all the paddy and non-paddy fields into standardized fields as befits the land of socialist Korea in the coming few years. The commissioning of the Kaechon-Lake Thaesong Waterway project should be accelerated. We should strive to provide the people with meat, eggs and fish, so that they can enjoy the benefits from them. Recently the Party has seen to it that several modern chicken farms were built for both soldiers and civilians. The newly built chicken farms should be operated properly, and at the same time the chicken farms built in the 75 past should be renovated. In order to provide our people with a rich diet, President Kim Il Sung had chicken farms built in various parts of the country, selecting their sites personally. But as some officials have failed to operate them as they should, few are running properly now. Those built in Pyongyang produced meat and eggs fairly well for some years and supplied them to the people of Pyongyang, but this is not the case now. So last year I took the measure of conducting technological upgrading of these farms in a bold fashion. This is a way to add lustre to President Kim Il Sung’s exploits and bring his wishes to fruition. While upgrading the chicken farms in Pyongyang technologically, we should equip them with the capacity for producing chicken meat and eggs for patients in hospitals as well as for leading scientists, artistes and athletes. Close attention should be paid to building bases for producing chicken feed. One of the reasons why the chicken farms failed to prove their worth in the past was that they had not been provided with sufficient amounts of chicken feed. We should keep solving the problem of chicken feed, like the technological upgrading of the assorted feed factory Where necessary, the existing pig and duck farms should be reconstructed or renovated, and operated properly. Grass-eating domestic animals should be raised as a mass drive to supply enough meat to the people. Goats and rabbits should be raised continually on a large scale. Every undertaking should be done with complete consistency without being given up halfway. Now that we have built modern catfish farms and other fish farms, we should make sure they are provided with fish feed and run well, so that fish can become common on the people’s dining tables. We have also built a modern condiment factory in every province, to mark the 55th anniversary of Party founding. We should organize the work of providing them with soy beans and other raw materials from the beginning so as to produce tasty bean paste and soy sauce, and supply them in sufficient quantities to the people. In addition, superior oil-bearing crops should be cultivated on a large scale to 76 solve the problem of cooking oil. We should also solve the problem of consumer goods. As we have been on the Arduous March, we have failed to properly provide the people with essential consumer goods. We should solve the problem as soon as possible. We should direct the main effort to solving the problem of primary commodities, like cloth, underwear, footwear and soap, and produce other consumer goods and sundry goods in large quantities, and provide them efficiently to the people. Buttons, clothes brushes, shoe brushes, coat hangers, hair-pins and other minor goods can be fully produced if latent materials are enlisted. If we are to solve the problem of consumer goods, we have to equip the light-industry factories with the latest technology. The light-industry factories in our country are not proving satisfactory as their equipment is old and outdated. We should upgrade the lightindustry factories, like textile mills and footwear factories, with the latest technology in the way we renovated the Sinuiju Cosmetics Factory by importing the latest equipment. We should build dwelling houses in large numbers. We have built many houses so far, but we are yet to satisfy the increasing demand for houses. If we are to satisfy the demand, we have to build tens of thousands of flats every year in Pyongyang alone. Provinces, cities and counties, too, should build many houses by enlisting the local materials as suited to their local conditions. The experience gained by Jagang, Ryanggang and South Hwanghae provinces shows that fine dwelling houses can be built if the roofing materials like earthen roofing tiles and slates are available. If we are to build dwelling houses, we should build them to the standard of the new century, be they in a city or in the countryside. We should also take measures to provide heating, fuel and drinking water to the dwelling houses so that people will not feel any inconvenience in their everyday lives. We should build many rest homes, recuperation centres and sanatoria in the places with beautiful scenery and clear water, renovate the existing ones and run them well for the people to enjoy social benefits to the full. This year we should stop building public 77 establishments; instead, we should build many rest homes, recuperation centres and sanatoria. We must reunify the country as soon as possible. President Kim Il Sung, saying that the greatest gift he could give to our people was a reunified country, devoted his all to realizing the cause of national reunification. The document he was going over at the last moment of his life was one concerning national reunification. The holding of the historic summit meeting in Pyongyang and adoption of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration last year was an epochmaking event in the effort for national reunification. What is important in realizing national reunification is to achieve national unity. As I said when I met a delegation of media organs from south Korea, we will join hands with anyone who supports the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration irrespective of their past activities. If we begin to call others’ past activities into question, we cannot achieve national unity. President Kim Il Sung was bold in embracing those who had been engaged in anti-communism in the past but were willing to take the road to national reunification. We should achieve national unity by enlisting all those who support national reunification. In order to realize national reunification we should further consolidate our revolutionary ranks. While we strengthen the army as a buttress of the revolution, we should firmly rally the broad sections of the masses around the Party and thus consolidate the revolutionary ranks rock-solid. We should give an effective explanation to the Party members and other working people to enable them to have a correct understanding of the present situation of our revolution. Only then will they harbour no illusion about the imperialist reactionaries whatever the situation, and staunchly maintain revolutionary and class principles. We should wage an all-out offensive against non-socialist practices to eliminate them once and for all. Non-socialist practices are dangerous elements that benumb the people’s sound ideological consciousness and gnaw at the single-hearted unity of the Party and 78 the revolutionary ranks. The course by which a socialist society develops to perfection is, in its nature, a course by which it overcomes all manner of non-socialist practices that run counter to its intrinsic demands. Only when the masses of the people, who have been freed from exploitation and oppression, are freed also from the shackles of non-socialist elements can the base on which the antisocialist forces may gain a foothold be abolished once and for all and the definite victory of socialism be achieved. The Party and working people’s organizations and law-enforcement organs should intensify ideological education, ideological struggle and legal control for eliminating various non-socialist practices revealed among the people, so as to see to it that such practices do not crop up again. We should guard against the ideological and cultural infiltration by the imperialists. The US and other imperialists are tenacious in their attempts to make the decadent bourgeois ideology and culture permeate our country so as to undermine our revolutionary ranks. We should prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology and culture and Western way of life by making our “mosquito net” even tighter than ever before, and should the slightest tendency of such things be revealed, deal a fatal blow to it in time, thus preserving the purity of the revolutionary ranks. We should do everything in our own way in the new century, too. “Let us live our own way!”–this is a strategic slogan we should continue to hold aloft as we march into the new century. We should administer independence-based politics in a thoroughgoing way. Independence-based politics is essential for defending the self-respect of a country and a nation. We could stand by socialism when it crumbled in several countries and can enjoy high self-respect and international authority today because we have consistently pursued independence-based politics. Whatever the circumstances, we should firmly adhere to independence, formulate all our lines and policies in conformity with the actual conditions of our revolution and our country and the interests of our people, and implement them by relying on the efforts of our people. 79 We should invariably keep to the line of Songun politics. Songun politics is a new political mode of our own style, which we have perfected by applying the idea of attaching importance to arms in conformity with the practical conditions of today. Our Party’s idea of attaching importance to arms is based on the principle of the revolution that the independence and prosperity of a country and a nation as well as the victory of the cause of their revolution are assured by arms. In order to take the initiative in coping with the high-handed schemes of the imperialists, we opted for the mode of Songun politics, raised the status of the National Defence Commission within the state structural hierarchy, and encouraged the armed forces to play important roles in all the domains of state and social life. In our country today Songun politics has been perfected as a systematized political mode. Songun politics is a strategic political mode we should adhere to consistently as long as imperialism remains on the earth. Though the Party’s Songun politics is a political mode that has been perfected in the historical conditions of today, it is a legacy and development of President Kim Il Sung’s mode of leading the revolution. By origin, Songun is a revolutionary mode he consistently adhered to in the whole course of leading the Korean revolution. The history of his revolutionary activities can be called the history of Songun-based revolutionary leadership. He pioneered our revolution and led it to victory through Songun-based revolutionary leadership. The exploits and experiences of his Songun-based revolutionary leadership formed the basis of the Songun politics we are practicing today. Inheriting his Songun idea, we developed it as a political mode that suits the practical conditions of today. This is why our Party’s Songun politics is a revolutionary political mode that makes it possible to carry out the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered by President Kim Il Sung. Officials should have a correct understanding of the justness and invincibility of the Party’s Songun politics, and fully meet its demands. We should continuously channel great efforts to strengthening the 80 armed forces. By further intensifying the political and ideological training of the service personnel we should bring them up to be strong in ideology, faith and willpower, to be unfailingly faithful to the Party and the revolution, and encourage them to give fuller play to the revolutionary soldier spirit and militant way of living. The People’s Army should become not only a fortress that defends the country by force of arms but also a stronghold of faith that defends the Party and the revolution by force of ideological spirit, as well as a pioneer and prototype that imbues the civilians with the revolutionary ideological spirit and way of fighting. It should be ensured that the service personnel, by giving full play to the fine trait of unity between the army and the people, continue to love and actively help the people and remain exemplary in achieving a breakthrough in the difficult and challenging fronts of the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country. Perfecting the combat readiness of the People’s Army to cope with the US imperialists’ moves to ignite a new war is the first and foremost task facing the People’s Army. The first objective of our Songun politics is to take the initiative in coping with the US imperialists’ aggressive moves. The People’s Army should concentrate its efforts on perfecting its combat readiness so that it can frustrate the US imperialists’ aggressive moves at a stroke. Strengthening the home front is very important in consolidating the country’s defence capabilities. Party organizations and power organs should step up their efforts to build the country into a great, prosperous and powerful one, thus solidifying the home front in the political and ideological, material and economic aspects, and the allpeople defence system. We should create a climate, in which the whole society attaches importance to military affairs, and provides, on a preferential basis, the things required by the People’s Army and the defence industry with the view and standpoint that precedence should be given to the armed forces and everything subordinated to military affairs. We should imbue the people with the idea of giving importance to arms 81 and the idea of supporting the armed forces to see to it that this work is undertaken as a society-wide drive. We should ensure that all the Party members and other working people are sincere in acquiring knowledge concerning military affairs. We should vigorously undertake the drive to learn from the revolutionary spirit and way of fighting of the service personnel. I frequently inspect the People’s Army units and direct efforts to the work of the People’s Army not only to strengthen the armed forces but to model the whole society after the armed forces and imbue it with the revolutionary spirit of the service personnel and their militant way of life. The essence of this revolutionary spirit is the spirit of defending the leader unto death, the spirit of implementing his orders even at the risk of one’s life and the spirit of heroic selfsacrifice. Party organizations should give wide publicity to the vivid examples of the displaying of these aspects of the revolutionary spirit and encourage all the Party members and other working people to learn from these examples so that they can work devotedly for the Party and the leader, for the country and the people in deeds, not just in words. They should also encourage them to actively learn from the traits of revolutionary comradeship and unity between the officers and men, the spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, the strong sense of organization and discipline and the way of organizing life assiduously. We should apply benevolent politics correctly. Benevolent politics, the politics of love for and trust in the masses of the people, is a mode of politics emanating from the intrinsic nature of socialism. Love for and trust in the masses constitute the essence of politics in socialist society, and herein lie the advantages of socialist politics. Benevolent politics in socialist society is preconditioned by a strong armed force. As long as there exists the threat of imperialist aggression, we cannot provide the people with an independent and creative life unless we have a strong defence. Benevolent politics makes it possible to better satisfy the requirements of Songun politics by solidifying the single-hearted unity of the whole society. We 82 should adhere to both Songun politics and benevolent politics, and satisfy their requirements. We should embrace and lead those who trust and follow the Party however chequered their family backgrounds and socio-political career may be, and approach the problems concerning people from the point of the interests of the revolution before dealing with them correctly. We should hold fast to the policy of attaching importance to science and technology and implement it thoroughly. The present is an era of science and technology, a computer era. Today, when science and technology are developing at exponential speed, things which people thought illusory are turning into reality. In order for us to build a great, prosperous and powerful country as soon as possible, we should attach great importance to science and technology. Recently I put forward science and technology as a pillar in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country, and emphasized that great importance should be given to science and technology. However, we are yet to say that a climate has been created of giving such importance to science and technology. Only lip service is given to it, and no particular measures have been taken and implemented substantively. Unless we rely on cutting-edge science and technology, we cannot consolidate our economic or defence capabilities. All the officials, aware that they cannot advance even a step without relying on science and technology in the present era, should take the firm stand of solving the problems arising in all sectors and units by relying on science and technology. In implementing the policy of attaching great importance to science and technology, we should concentrate our efforts on solving the scientific and technological problems arising in the technological upgrading of the national economy as a whole. Without renovating the overall national economy by means of cutting-edge technology, we cannot build a great, prosperous and powerful country. The great, prosperous and powerful country we are building should be one based on a high standard of science and technology commensurate with the 21st century, so if we are to build or renovate a factory, we should do 83 it so that it is perfect as befits the new century. Scientists, technicians and scientific research institutes should discard outdated views and passive attitudes, and boldly open the new frontiers of the cuttingedge science and technology so as to perform the technological upgrading of the national economy to a high standard as demanded by the new century. We should increase investment in the sectors of science and technology. We must not spare money needed for developing science and technology. We should give prominence to scientists and technicians, and provide them with good conditions for working and living. Scientists and technicians are talented people who serve the Party and the revolution, the country and the people with science and technology. Officials should help them so that they can achieve success in their research work with confidence and courage, and put their new achievements into practice in time. Such malpractices as giving the scientific research institutes social tasks without discrimination or seconding scientists and technicians to undertakings irrelevant to their research work should be discarded. If a climate of attaching great importance to science and technology is to be established in all fields, a drive should be launched throughout society for learning modern science and technology. In particular, cadres should stand in the van of learning modern science and technology. Some cadres, with a poor knowledge of science and technology, give a wide berth to problems related to science and technology when they are raised, or disregard plans of technical innovation submitted by scientists and technicians. They do not think how to manage and develop the economy based on modern science and technology. Recently the Party had prototype computerized factories built and had officials look round them so as to enlighten them. They can digest what they have seen only when they are well versed in science and technology. It should be made a social climate that everyone learns modern science and technology. We should consistently adhere to the policy of giving prominence 84 to the youth, and efficiently work with them. Young people are the dependable successors to the revolution and a most vibrant segment of society. It is only when we train them well that we can invariably defend our style of socialism and successfully build a great, prosperous and powerful country. We should educate them effectively so that they can carry forward the revolution without forgetting their origin. The present mental state of our young people is excellent. We should further intensify education in loyalty among them to ensure that they worship their leader without any question, defend him at the risk of their lives and turn out to his call no matter what difficulties they face. We should also intensify revolutionary education, class education and education in socialist patriotism among them so that they all love their socialist motherland ardently and fight the class enemies steadfastly cherishing burning hatred. We should ensure that all the young people become a shock force in making breakthroughs in the difficult and labour-consuming fronts of the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country. In view of the fact that they built the excellent Youth Hero Motorway literally with their bare hands in the days of the Arduous March and forced march, their strength is great. As long as we have such young people, we have nothing to fear and nothing we cannot perform. We should lead them to maintain in the new century the spirit and mettle they displayed in the days of the Arduous March and forced march, and volunteer before anybody else for the difficult and labour-consuming fronts to make breakthroughs in those fronts, thus demonstrating the heroic stamina and merits of Korean youth. We should also ensure that they regard it as an obligation to defend the country and as a great honour and pride to serve in the armed forces. We should build up the youth league, and enhance its functions and role. Our youth league is a prestigious organization named after President Kim Il Sung. We should build it up as a militant organization with strong organizing ability, strength of unity and fighting efficiency, and give it effective assistance so that it can work 85 independently and full of vigour. We should educate the rising generation well. To give precedence to education over all other work, to spare nothing for bringing up the new generation and to subordinate everything to it is an important policy President Kim Il Sung advanced long ago. The future of a nation depends on how its new generation is brought up, so we should effect a decisive improvement in the education of our rising generation as demanded by the new century. We should improve the quality of school education. In particular, we should direct great efforts to education in cutting-edge science and technology, like computer education. Unless we channel efforts into computer education, we cannot quickly enter the ranks of the advanced countries. Schools should put due stress on computer education to produce computer wizards in large numbers. Computer education proves effective only when it is given to those at young age. We should build up the bases for training computer geniuses, select proper candidates for the bases, formulate appropriate plans for teaching them and compile suitable textbooks for them. The curriculum should be designated properly. At present too many subjects are taught to the students, resulting in poor production of gifted people in specified fields of science and technology. For those to be raised as computer geniuses, computer and mathematics should be the major subjects, and only the revolutionary history should be taught as a general subject. The revolutionary history should be an indispensable subject as one may not know how the socialist system has been built in our country and for whom one must work if one does not learn the history. If we are to successfully perform the tasks facing us, we should consolidate the Party and the people’s government, and enhance their roles. One should not think that we may weaken the Party and the people’s government on the plea that Songun politics is being administered. Songun politics will exert greater strength when the Party and the people’s government are consolidated. By nature, the party, the people’s government and the armed forces all constitute 86 important weapons in the revolutionary struggle of the working class. Before the working class seizes power, the party and the armed forces are its most powerful weapons in the revolution; after it seizes power, the people’s government becomes another powerful weapon for it. In order to accomplish the cause of socialism we should consolidate the Party, the people’s government and the armed forces all together. The working-class party is a political guide and the organizer of all victories. It is only when the party correctly performs its leadership role and functions that socialism can display its advantages and strength to the full. All sectors should thoroughly establish the Party’s leadership system. Strengthening the Party is aimed at leading the revolution and construction effectively, which are inconceivable separate from the Party’s leadership system. All Party organizations should establish strict discipline by which important issues are brought to the Party without exception and dealt with according to the Party’s opinion, and a revolutionary way of accepting the Party’s lines and policies and carrying them out without any question. Revolutionary discipline should be established by which all policies, once advanced, are implemented to the letter, so that all the lines and policies of the Party are carried out faithfully. The functions and roles of Party organizations should be enhanced decisively. The Party’s leadership over the entire Party and the whole society is realized through its organizations; so it is only when the Party organizations enhance their functions and roles that the Party can fully perform its mission and duty. Recently the Party organizations in the People’s Army have been working effectively; the Party organizations in society, too, should make redoubled efforts to enhance their functions and roles decisively. Party organizations should establish a clear-cut system of grasping the conditions of their subordinate units to get to know them intimately. The Party organizations in the upper echelons should have their subordinate units at strict command and control them so as to make them work full of enthusiasm. They should control and guide 87 the judicial, prosecutorial and people’s security organs so that the officials in these law-enforcement organs ensure the functioning of the people’s democratic dictatorship as demanded by the situation, distinguish right from wrong and refrain from committing Rightist and “Leftist” errors. Party organizations should conduct organization and guidance of the Party life of cadres and other Party members in close combination with their implementation of revolutionary tasks, and lead them to properly implement the tasks assigned to them. We should decisively decrease the frequency of meetings and paperwork. I have stressed this almost every year, but this problem dies hard. Now that we have entered a new century we should be bold in freeing ourselves from the outdated patterns, decisively decreasing the frequency of meetings and paperwork and changing the forms and methods of holding meetings. We should bring about a fresh turn in the ideological work of the Party. In conformity with the requirements of today’s reality, when the situation is changing continuously, we should conduct the ideological work of the Party in a fresh and lifelike fashion. It should not be done like a flash in the pan. What has to be done steadily until a strategic and tactical aim is achieved should be kept up with all consistency. People’s power organs are the executors of the Party’s policies, and are responsible for the people’s livelihood. They should take full responsibility for administrative and economic work. They should take measures in time for implementing the Party’s policies, and carry them out unconditionally. They should organize and command the administrative and economic work down to the last detail, and execute their economic tasks properly. They should see to it that the laws, decisions and directives of the state are implemented to the letter by establishing rigid administrative discipline, and address the inconveniences in the people’s livelihood with a high sense of responsibility. Cadres should enhance their sense of responsibility and role. 88 Whether we implement the tasks facing us with success or not depends on how cadres, the commanding personnel of the revolution, work. Cadres should cherish unfailing loyalty to the Party and their leader, and support the Party’s ideology and leadership sincerely and without affectation. Kim Il, O Jin U and other veterans of the antiJapanese revolution were exemplary in supporting the Party with sincerity; they showed no affectation and were honest in supporting the Party. In the days of laying the foundations of the Party for carrying forward the Juche cause, too, there were many officials who supported the Party sincerely. Among them there are some who have not been entombed at the Patriotic Martyrs Cemetery. We should locate them all, and entomb them there. If they are entombed at the cemetery and their photographic images carved on stone are put up on their tombstones, their political integrity will be further glorified and their family members and other relatives will be pleased. Cadres should improve their practical abilities. Quite a few officials say that they wish to prove themselves worthy of the Party’s trust by means of loyalty. They should prove themselves worthy of it not just in words, but in using their practical abilities. The greatest weak point of cadres at the moment is that their practical abilities are not keeping step with the demands of the developing reality. They should diligently study to raise their political and practical qualifications and scientific and technical standards, and go to the production sites to work shoulder to shoulder with the workers and farmers, and learn from them open-heartedly. Cadres should effect a fundamental improvement in their methods of work. The 21st century is a century of gigantic transformation, a century of creation. If they cling to the outdated methods of work in the days of advance, when everyone has to dash at top speed, they cannot perform feats of labour. When I was giving field guidance to several sectors, I found that renovations are being made and miracles are wrought in the units whose officials are bold in planning and developing their work even under the difficult conditions. The Party 89 is in need of men and women of action who are audacious and courageous. Holding aloft the slogan “Be bold in planning and putting it into practice!” cadres should plan all undertakings in an ambitious way proceeding from an innovative point of view, and push ahead with them doggedly until they are completed. They should refrain from abusing their authority and practising bureaucratism. If they infringe upon the people’s interests by abusing their authority and practising bureaucratism, people may experience inconveniences, it may dampen their revolutionary enthusiasm and not everything may go ahead smoothly. All the officials should become faithful servants of the people, who thoroughly champion their interests and responsibly look after their livelihood, and make examples of themselves by leading an equal life with the people and setting patterns for working and living. They should become standardbearers who lead the masses by standing in the van and setting personal examples. I clarified the direction of this year’s work on several occasions last year. Party organizations should carry out all the policies of the Party by launching the organizational and political work vigorously, and thus make this year a turning point in opening the road of advance

12.04.2001,Kim Jong Il,"The National Conference of the Primary Information Workers of the Party is being held at a time when the whole country and all the people have made a vigorous start of the advance following our Party into the hope-filled 21st century. The national conference, the first of its kind in the history of our Party, will serve as an important occasion in enhancing the sense of responsibility and role of the primary information workers of the Party and bringing about a turn in the overall ideological work of the Party as required by the revolutionary advance in the new century. I extend my warm congratulations to the participants in the conference and all other primary information workers of the Party, who are working devotedly in the forefront of the ideological work of the Party under its leadership. It is a principle our Party consistently maintains in leading the revolution and construction to achieve victory by putting the main emphasis on ideology and enlisting the ideological strength of the masses of the people. Our Party overcame the trying hardships in the last decade of the 20th century on the solid basis of ideology as well as by force of arms. 110 Now the ideological and mental state of our people is very good, and the political and ideological position of our revolution is firm. This provides us with a sure guarantee for achieving a greater victory. That our people adorned the 20th century with the victory of socialism of our own style and have set out on an advance in the new century looking forward to a bright future is a brilliant fruition of our Party’s unique line of giving importance to ideology. Now our revolution has entered a new stage of development. The 21st century is one in which a new era of the Juche revolution will flourish in an all-round way, and our country will demonstrate its dignity as a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country. Our struggle in the new century is a heroic advance, in which we, under the leadership of the Party, will make great innovations and a great leap forward unprecedented in the history of the building of our country. In order to step up the great advance for gigantic creation and change braving the tempest of the revolution, we should improve the ideological work of the Party, which is geared to preparing and motivating the masses, the motive force of the advance, in a revolutionary manner. The sector of ideological work of the Party must set clear objectives for its work in conformity with the requirements of the revolution and construction in the new century, and carry them out while invariably holding up the modelling the whole society on the Juche idea as its ultimate objective. The basic task of the Party’s ideological work at present is to rally all the members of society firmly around the Party by training them as genuine revolutionaries boundlessly loyal to the Party and the leader, and dynamically enlist all the Party members and other working people in the effort to achieve the prosperity of the country. In order for the revolution to make an uninterrupted advance and be brought to completion in the present era, when the ideas and leadership of our Party are embodied in an all-round way, the entire Party and all the people should share the Party’s aim and destiny. In the Party’s ideological work, information and education should be geared to training all the Party members and other people as staunch 111 fighters who venerate the Party and the leader absolutely, and defend the leadership of the revolution even at the cost of their lives and consolidating the single-hearted unity of the entire Party and whole society based on boundless loyalty to the Party and warm comradely love. The building of a great, prosperous and powerful country is a new, higher stage of socialist construction, which is propelled by firm faith in socialism and ardent patriotic devotion, and advanced based on upto-date science and technology. In the Party’s ideological work, the main effort of information and motivational work should be concentrated on encouraging the Party members and other working people to acquire the traits and qualifications which befit the builders of a great, prosperous and powerful country, and work heart and soul for the implementation of the Party’s plan for the building of a thriving country. It is a fundamental requirement for improving the Party’s ideological work to conduct information and motivational work in an innovative manner in conformity with the new environment and atmosphere. We should conduct ideological work in a fresh way corresponding to the situation in which a new century has started and the revolution and construction have entered a higher stage. While defending the Party’s leadership exploits in the field of ideological work, we should boldly get rid of the outmoded methods which do not suit today’s situation and actively search out the methods which meet the requirements of the new era and are highly effective. We should do away with the outmoded pattern of formalism, an old work style of the last century, and gear all types of information and motivational work to remoulding and stimulating the people’s ideology in a substantial manner. To enhance the sense of responsibility and role of the primary information workers of the Party is very important in effecting a turn in the Party’s ideological work as demanded by the new century. The primary information workers of the Party stand in the van of 112 ideological work and are political campaigners who personally conduct information and motivational work among the Party members and other working people in pursuance of the Party’s policy on ideological work. How deeply the Party’s ideological work is conducted among the people and what fruit it bears depend largely on the primary information workers of the Party. This is why our Party has always given prominence to them, and helped and led them to carry out their task with credit. To educate and motivate people through primary information workers is our Party’s proud tradition of ideological work which was created in the flames of the anti-Japanese struggle and has been applied in the whole course of our revolution. To conduct vigorous information and motivational work by firmly building up the ranks of primary information workers and establishing a well-regulated system of their activities is a style of ideological work unique to our Party. Intensifying the activities of the primary information workers of the Party is all the more important today, when our Party is faced with a heavy revolutionary task of realizing the life-long wish of President Kim Il Sung and the centuries-old desire of our people by reunifying the nation and building a great, prosperous and powerful country. The primary information workers of the Party should become our Party’s faithful servants in realizing the revolutionary leadership of the Party, which is leading the effort to build a thriving country to victory while smashing the enemy’s challenges and overcoming all sorts of hardships on the strength of the revolutionary ideology of Juche. Great are the forces of the primary information workers of the Party brought up by the Party, and nothing will be impossible for us if they enhance their role. Upholding the Party’s expectations of them, the participants in the conference and other primary information workers of the Party across the country should conduct information and motivational work even more vigorously on the frontline of ideology and politics, and of struggle and progress. They should energetically conduct information work and 113 education focused on the greatness of the Party and the leader and the Party’s policies. Today’s revolution and construction are a struggle to materialize President Kim Il Sung’s intentions and cause under the Party’s leadership. The most important task facing the primary information workers of the Party is to bring the greatness of the Party and the leader and the Party’s policies home to all the Party members and other working people so as to encourage them to uphold President Kim Il Sung and the Party as their spiritual pillars, and carry out the Party’s plans geared to realizing the President’s wishes. The primary information workers of the Party should make information about the greatness of the Party and the leader as the core of their work. It is our Party’s firm will to hand down the greatness of President Kim Il Sung generation after generation and immortalize his revolutionary career. The President was the greatest representative of the 20th century, in that he performed undying exploits for the Korean revolution and the world revolution through his 70-odd-year leadership of the revolutionary cause of the masses. By ceaselessly spreading information about his peerless greatness and immortal revolutionary exploits, we should encourage the people to cherish boundless pride and dignity of being members of the Kim Il Sung’s nation and hold him in high esteem as the eternal sun of Juche. We should conduct information about his greatness without letup so as to enable not only our generation but also the coming generations to inherit forever the tradition of our Party and people of being loyal to him. True to the Party’s intention, the primary information workers of the Party should conduct more deeply and more effectively information about his greatness so as to induce the people to revere him forever and brilliantly carry out his behests and cause under the banner of the Juche idea. By making information about his greatness run through the whole course and content of the information and motivational work, they should encourage the Party members and other working people to 114 always call to mind the solemn image of the President, remember his exploits and benevolence at all times, and fulfil their duty as his revolutionary soldiers and disciples at all times and in all places. Ours is a great party which led the revolutionary struggle in the 20th century to victory under the banner of the Juche idea and pursues outstanding politics that steers the 21st century. The primary information workers of the Party should actively explain and propagate the greatness of our Party which leads the Korean revolution and the cause of human independence to victory at the helm of the Juche revolution, and the greatness of our Party’s politics that ushers in a new era of prosperity through Songun-based revolutionary leadership under the banner of independence, unity and patriotism. Thereby they will encourage all the people to faithfully support its leadership full of pride and dignity in making revolution under the leadership of the great Party. They should explain and propagate in close combination with their life experiences the chronicles of the revolution in which are etched the ideology, politics and leadership traits of the Party which led the Arduous March and forced march to victory. In this way, they should help the Party members and other working people put firmer trust in the Party, learn its intentions and will and the principles and methods of the revolution of our own style, and cultivate ardent patriotism and sense of devoted service. The primary information workers of the Party should strictly adhere to the Party’s lines and policies in conducting their information and motivational work. It is of great importance to bring home to the masses the Party’s lines and policies, which are our fighting programme and militant banner in opening up the 21st century, and make them regard these as their very own concern. Under the slogan “Let the primary information workers of the Party become active propagators of the Party’s policies and pioneers in their implementation!” all the primary information workers of the Party should bend their energy to equipping the Party members and other working people with the lines 115 and policies of the Party and induce the broad sections of the masses to burn with the will to implement them. The Songun-based revolutionary line is a basic strategic line our Party adheres to in building a great, prosperous and powerful country and accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche. By channelling great efforts into bringing the justness and invincible might of the Songun-based revolutionary line of the Party home to all the Party members and other working people, and motivating them to embody the requirements of the line, the primary information workers of the Party should encourage them to maintain the principle of giving priority to military affairs, create an atmosphere of attaching importance to the force of arms and actively learn from the revolutionary spirit and fighting mettle of the soldiers of the People’s Army. They should also provide them with a deep understanding of attaching importance to science and technology and to the youth and other strategic lines and major policies our Party maintains in the course of the revolution and construction. They should sensitively accept the policies the Party advances in each period of the revolution, and give timely and correct explanations of them. They should give wide publicity to the policies of technical upgrading geared to modernizing the national economy and making it IT-based, of applying the theory of the seed, of making a change in potato farming, of double-cropping, of developing fish farming and stockbreeding, of land administration and realignment and other important policies the Party has laid before the entire Party and the whole country, as well as the tasks of their respective sectors and units aimed at implementing the Party’s policies. They should not only provide the Party members and other working people with a full understanding of the Party’s policies but also proactively educate and encourage them to carry them out unconditionally. By conducting a brisk information and motivational campaign for promoting the death-defying and thorough implementation of the Party’s policies, they should ensure that the whole society pulsates with the revolutionary soldier spirit and 116 Kanggye spirit, and that epoch-making successes are achieved in all the sectors of the revolution and construction. They should step up the remoulding of man, remoulding his ideology, through efficient work with people. Today’s grand revolutionary advance is not only a struggle for building up strong national economic capabilities but also a furnace of human remoulding for doing away with all outdated and unsound things, and bringing about a revolutionary change in people’s ideological consciousness and social life. It is an important task of the primary information workers of the Party to effect an ideological and mental surge in the Party members and other working people by energetically conducting work with people, work of human remoulding. They should conduct political work for awakening the people to and inspiring them with the sense of revolution wherever the people are, and always mingle with the masses to create positive examples and remould those who are lagging behind. By doing this they will make an active contribution to raising the revolutionary consciousness of the Party members and other working people in the course of the new revolutionary advance. In the period of the Chollima march in the 1960s the primary information workers of the Party conducted the work of human remoulding in an effective way. Our Party expects that the present primary information workers of the Party will become pioneers of human remoulding in the era of building a great, prosperous and powerful country by briskly conducting the work with people, work for remoulding their ideology, as the pioneers of human remoulding in the days of the grand Chollima upsurge did. What is important in the remoulding of man, in the remoulding of his ideology, at present is to induce the Party members and other working people to acquire the attitude which befits the masters of the state and society and the view with which they identify their happiness with the prosperity of the nation and thereby work more and harder. If we are to build a great, prosperous and powerful country whose national strength is great and in which all the people 117 are well-off, every one of us must work hard. It is a pipe dream to yearn for a rich life without working heart and soul. The primary information workers of the Party should encourage all the Party members and other working people to achieve great feats of labour through persevering and sincere labour by imbuing them with the awareness that in order to accelerate the day of national prosperity, they, the masters of the state and society, have to work with redoubled efforts. They should perseveringly enlighten or struggle against idlers so as to ensure that there is no one who eats the bread of idleness at the expense of the advantageous socialist system. Our Party demands that the officials and working people make a revolutionary upsurge in their way of thinking and in their manner and style of work in keeping with the revolutionary advance in the new century. The primary information workers of the Party should teach and lead the people to get rid of the outdated concepts and way of thinking of the past and deal with everything in an innovative way as they proceed from a new point of view and a new standard. They should also propagate the latest scientific and technological knowledge among the Party members and other working people. The building of a great, prosperous and powerful country is accompanied by a severe class struggle, and the changes in the current situation are very complicated. By sensitively grasping the psychology and sentiments of the masses and effectively conducting the work to improve their class awareness, the primary information workers of the Party should make sure that the Party members and other working people never harbour any illusion about the enemy but strictly adhere to the class principle and the principle of antiimperialist struggle no matter how the situation may change, and that bourgeois ideology and culture and the Western way of life do not make inroads into our ranks. Today, when the struggle for developing and accomplishing socialism is being waged on a full scale, non-socialist practices are the main target of the work for the remoulding of man, remoulding his ideology. The primary information workers of the Party should 118 conduct vigorous ideological education and campaigns to eradicate all hues of non-socialist attitude towards life. They should effectively help those who cling to a non-socialist way of life to live a life proper to our society at the same time as perseveringly educating them so that they can root out that erroneous way of life. They should also remould those who are steeped in moral traits and conventions bequeathed from the old society and thus help make the revolutionary and noble socialist morality and way of life prevail throughout society. They should apply the revolutionary principle of activity and creative methods of information and motivational work. To establish political principles firmly is one of the fundamentals they should adhere to in their work. To establish political principles means to make the Party’s ideas and intentions run through all activities and gear the latter to defending and embodying the former under the monolithic leadership of the Party. As it is a method of realizing the Party’s leadership, the activity of the primary information workers of the Party must at all times be the one to correctly represent and propagate the Party’s ideas and intentions. This is all the more important as they work at the lowest level linking the Party and the masses ideologically. If, thinking that establishing political principles is something solely incumbent on their superiors, they pay no attention to establishing the political principles or work in a haphazard fashion without stressing the main points, they can hardly achieve success in their work. Worse still, this may have a negative impact on the masses. Whatever they deal with in information and motivational work, they must draw distinct political and class lines as required by the Party, and pay primary attention to the main ideological and political points and giving a correct explanation of them to the masses. The primary information workers of the Party should make the most of their information and motivational work by working in a positive and creative manner. Positiveness and creativeness constitute characteristic features of 119 the mode of their activity and major factors guaranteeing its success. By working in a positive and creative fashion they can become the masters of their work and achieve success through their own efforts and wisdom. Ideological work is itself a highly creative endeavour, and the activities of the primary information workers of the Party should be more positive and creative. As they work in direct contact with people of various social strata and under ever-changing concrete situations, they cannot be effective in their work if they mechanically transmit as they are the materials and data for public education, which they are given by their superiors. They should acquire the habit of always studying to find out by themselves methods for enhancing the efficiency of their work. They should not just wait for their superiors to provide them with effective methods and schemes for their work. There cannot be any fixed formula or panacea in ideological work. They should have their own plans and methodology to conduct the information and motivational work in a most effective way. They should make it a habit to always think how they can sow good seeds to reap a good harvest, and find excellent methods through creative thinking and earnest inquiry. They should discard stereotyped, outdated methods of work and apply fresh and efficient ones. Our Party has consistently stressed the need to apply the methods of the anti-Japanese guerrillas in information and motivational work, i.e. the methods of frontline-style political work, and puts high demands upon it as the revolutionary advance in the new century progresses. Public lecturers should get rid of the method of simply dictating or reading lecture materials, and apply the heuristic method, a method of narrating the materials in simple, appealing words, so that the cadres and the working people can easily digest what they have learned. The information workers and the motivational workers in charge of five households each should discharge their duties on a regular basis and make skilful use of simple, mobile and yet persuasive methods of information and motivational work, not sticking to formalities or making serious things pretty. The primary information workers of the Party should 120 make wide use of articles carried in newspapers, periodicals, books and other kinds of publications in their work, and attentively listen to radio broadcasts so as to inform the masses of the news. Now the People’s Army is effectively applying the information and motivational methods of the anti-Japanese guerrillas in conformity with the characteristics of soldiers. The political lectures put the emphasis on the main point to enable the soldiers to etch in their minds right on the spot what they have learned. The army has produced educational materials ready on tables and has actively introduced them for educating the service personnel. The performances staged by the military amateur art groups are full of military flavours and are lively in content and form. The People’s Army’s news bulletins and wall pictures are profound, concise and distinct in their content and appealing to the eye. It conducts motivational work in such a way as is done on the battle field. The fact that the ideological and mental state of the service personnel is excellent is due to the armed forces conducting information and motivational work in an enterprising and effective manner in keeping with its characteristics. The civilian primary information workers of the Party should be proactive in learning from the examples created by the People’s Army and widely applying them to their work. The primary information workers of the Party should enhance their political and theoretical level and practical qualifications, and acquire traits becoming revolutionaries. They should constantly enhance the level of their political and practical abilities in keeping with the requirements of today’s reality, when socialist construction is being waged at the high stage of changing the whole appearance of the country in a modern fashion and the people are aspiring after the new in all spheres of ideology, technology and culture. By studying hard, the primary information workers of the Party should equip themselves firmly with the Juche idea of our Party, acquire a deep understanding of the Party’s plans and policies for the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country, acquire IT knowledge as well as 121 knowledge of other branches of modern science and technology and be well informed of current developments. Thereby they will prepare themselves to be masters of practical abilities and wide knowledge. Of course, they should also become skilful workers in the information, education and motivation fields by accumulating relevant experiences and mastering the skills they need in the course of their own work. They should make strong demands on themselves in acquiring the traits becoming revolutionaries. Loyalty to the Party and the leader is the first criterion for the primary information workers of the Party. As they are to educate and lead the masses, they have to support the Party with loyalty warmer and purer than others’. To enhance the sense of self-awareness and responsibility is of the greatest importance for those who conduct information and motivational work as a social assignment while carrying out their own revolutionary tasks. If they regard their social assignment as a burden or perform it in a perfunctory way this will have a detrimental impact on the Party’s ideological work as a whole. They should perform their social assignment in a responsible and substantial manner with a high degree of consciousness that they are performing it under the Party’s great trust and care. They should direct great efforts to carrying out their assignment even if it means resting or even sleeping less than others, and feel the worth of and pride in life as revolutionaries in doing so. As they work in direct contact with the broad masses, the primary information workers of the Party should possess the sense of serving the masses and being culturally refined; otherwise, they cannot intimately mingle with the masses to share their feelings nor become good examples for them to follow. Possessed of a revolutionary outlook on the masses, they should always respect them and educate and lead them, mingling with them. As they have to present themselves in front of the masses frequently and play the role of enlightening them culturally, they have to keep their appearance neat 122 and tidy, speak and behave in a refined way, be decorous and attain a high level of cultural attainment. They should always be exemplary in carrying out their own revolutionary tasks and in their everyday life. Only then can they be taken seriously by the masses, and command their trust and respect. As information and motivational work demands much effort, they should chalk up high records in carrying out their own revolutionary tasks with a determination to do the work of two or three persons each, and live a more revolutionary, cultured and honest life than anybody else does. In order to enhance the role and sense of responsibility of the primary information workers of the Party, Party organizations should improve the work with them with a proper view of them. The primary information workers of the Party are political workers who work directly under the guidance of Party organizations to perform the assignment entrusted to them by the Party and who contribute a great deal to the realization of its ideas and leadership. It is out of consideration for the importance of the role of the primary information workers who work in direct contact with the masses that when I give on-site guidance to the affairs of the People’s Army, I meet public lecturers and motivational workers to encourage them and attend political lectures and motivational meetings to teach them in detail how to work. Party organizations and Party officials should discard the attitude of slighting the primary information workers of the Party, pay close attention to their work and lead them in a responsible manner to work in line with the Party’s ideas and intentions. Party organizations should build up the ranks of the primary information workers of the Party with persons who are loyal to the Party, enthusiastic, competent and respected by the masses. They should give them clear-cut tasks, review the results of their work in detail, and lead them to perform their social assignment properly by working energetically. Party organizations should pay close attention to the days for lecturers of study sessions, the day for lecturers of 123 public lectures, the day for motivational workers and the day for information workers in charge of five households in a substantial manner on the stipulated dates, so as to give encouragement to the primary information workers of the Party in their work and teach them the latest work methods, thus helping them improve the level of their qualifications and cultural attainments. Party organizations should boost the pride and dignity of primary information workers, provide them with the optimum working conditions, reward exemplary primary information workers and pay due attention to popularizing their excellent experiences. Next year we shall be greeting the 90th birth anniversary of President Kim Il Sung. We must adorn the meaningful Day of the Sun of next year as a historic landmark in glorifying his imperishable revolutionary exploits forever and putting his lifetime wishes into reality. Party organizations and primary information workers of the Party should conduct an intensive political campaign for greeting the 90th birth anniversary of the President with a high degree of political enthusiasm and labour feats. Great are our Party’s trust in and expectations from the primary information workers of the Party in stepping up the revolutionary advance in the new century. I am firmly convinced that the participants in this conference and all other primary information workers of the Party will make active contributions to the consolidation of the Party and the building of a thriving country by bringing about a drastic change in information and motivational work in support of the Party’s leadership.",conference primary information worker party be hold vigorous start

24.07.2001,Kim Jong Il,"I am grateful that ITAR-Tass has requested an interview with me. I will be very pleased to answer your questions. First, I would like to talk about the relationship between Korea and Russia, and the prospects for its development. Korea and Russia are neighbours who have maintained traditional friendly relations for a long time. The development of these relations fully accords with the interests of the peoples of the two countries, and is of great significance in ensuring peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. We set great store by the friendship between Korea and Russia, and pay close attention to the development of relations between the two countries. The Pyongyang summit of the leaders of the two countries held in July last year was a landmark in developing the friendly relations between the two countries to a new and higher stage. The visit to Pyongyang by President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, the first by a Russian head of state, made a great contribution to the development of the relations between the two countries, and we highly appreciate it. Proceeding from our common determination and stand with regard to the further development of our friendly and cooperative relationship, President Putin and I had candid talks, deepening our mutual understanding and confidence. At the summit meeting and talks we had a frank exchange of 160 opinions concerning bilateral relations and a series of international issues of mutual concern. As a result of our discussions, we signed the DPRK-Russia Joint Declaration, in which we made public the common determination and desire of the governments and peoples of our two countries to develop the friendly and cooperative relations to a new and higher stage, and clarified our common view of and stand on important international issues. The Joint Declaration and the DPRK-Russia Treaty of Friendship, Good-Neighbourliness and Cooperation signed in February last year are historic documents that provide a guarantee for promoting the friendly relations between Korea and Russia. Clearly defining the principle and direction of the development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries, the declaration and the treaty deal comprehensively with political and foreign relations, national defence and security, mutual economic cooperation and trade issues, and all other matters arising in the development of bilateral relations. The declaration and the treaty created an opportunity to develop the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries in all fields on the principle of complete equality, mutual benefit, mutual confidence and non-interference in each other’s internal affairs. The future of the friendly relations between Korea and Russia is very bright. Since the Pyongyang summit broad sections of the societies in both countries have displayed unprecedented enthusiasm for developing the relationship between the two. In accordance with the spirit of the declaration and the treaty, practical measures have been taken by the two countries concerning cooperation in the fields of the economy, military affairs, science, technology, education and culture. Since the two countries’ determination to develop the relations of friendship and cooperation is unshakeable, guaranteed by the declaration and the treaty, and they have a decades-long tradition of close cooperation, they can develop their relations comprehensively if positive measures are taken. We believe that the Korea-Russia relationship will be strengthened remarkably in the new 161 century, the 21st century, by the joint efforts of the governments and peoples of the two countries. Dialogue between state leaders plays an important role in developing relations between countries. If the leaders maintain a close relationship with one another, their countries and peoples will inevitably establish friendly ties. I am going to visit Russia soon at the invitation of President Putin. I am pleased that I will be visiting Russia and meeting President Putin again in Moscow. Meeting the friendly people of Russia will be an emotional moment for me. I am sure that the upcoming Moscow summit will be an important occasion for cementing relations between the leaders of the two countries, which were established in Pyongyang last year, and for further promoting Korea-Russia friendship. As for the question of the United States’ establishment of its missile defence system, I shall touch upon the question since the United States is provoking us as part of this development. The United States is now clamouring about a so-called missile threat from our country and some others in an attempt to justify the setting up of the missile defence system. We are informed that in pursuit of its aims the United States is trying to abrogate the AntiBallistic Missile Treaty which it concluded with Russia. The United States’ attempt to establish the missile defence system has now become a target of world-wide denunciation because it may renew the arms race. We support Russia’s stand of maintaining strategic stability through the ABM Treaty. The United States’ accusation of a “missile threat” from our country is totally unfounded. It is nothing but a lie to hide its intention to dominate other countries. No matter how much noise they make, saying, “North Korea is threatening the United States by means of missiles,” and therefore “The United States is trembling with anxiety and fear,” nobody will believe it. Worse still, the new US administration is now talking about the “threat” of our conventional armed forces, not satisfied with the nonsense about “north Korea’s 162 missile threat.” That is preposterous. It is another outrageous challenge to us. Our missile programme is of a purely peaceful nature. It threatens nobody. Implementing a peaceful missile programme is no more than an exercise of our legitimate sovereign rights. The world knows that we are not threatening the United States, but that the United States is constantly threatening us by occupying half of our country by force of arms. You have also asked about the prospect of normalizing relations between our country and the United States and Japan. That depends entirely on the policies and attitudes of the latter two countries. The new US administration has resumed its policy of isolating and stifling the DPRK in the new century, a policy that had already proved to be bankrupt in the 20th century, and is obstructing the improvement of DPRK-US relations, instead aggravating the tense situation. The hardline policy pursued by the United States to bring pressure to bear on us is a futile attempt that failed yesterday and will fail today as well. Our consistent stand is to approach good will with good will and respond to a hard line with a harder line. Our independent foreign policy is consistent and principled. No matter how the situation may change, and no matter what challenges we may encounter, we will maintain the sovereignty and dignity of our country, and confidently advance along the road we have chosen. We will develop good-neighbourly, friendly relations with all countries on the basis of mutual respect for independence, and make efforts to improve relations with the countries which have previously been hostile towards us, provided they respect our sovereignty and discard their hostile policy. A prerequisite for improving our relations with Japan is that it should atone for the crimes it committed against our country and nation. To try to improve relations with Japan while ignoring its criminal past does not make sense. The present reactionary rulers of Japan are manoeuvring recklessly to put a pretty façade on and justify their shameful past, attempting to bury their crimes forever. 163 If Japan takes a sincere attitude towards the question of redressing its past, in line with global trends, and gives up its hostile policy and acts towards our country, the relationship between Korea and Japan can be improved. Finally, you have asked me how I spend my leisure time and what my hobbies are. Frankly speaking, I have a lot of work to do. Shouldering the lifetime mission of the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung, we must build a thriving socialist country on our land and achieve national reunification as soon as possible. That reality does not allow me to waste time before we have built a thriving country, and achieved national reunification. As for my hobbies, I am fond of mixing with soldiers and other people, and spending time with them. I find my life worth living and get most pleasure when I learn how they live and work, and take care of them, talking with them and sharing their feelings. I also like books and music. Reading and listening to music are a part of my life and a source of inspiration for my work. I would like to take this opportunity to convey my friendly greetings to the Russian people, and wish them every success in their struggle to build a powerful Russia and a better life.",grateful itar

03.12.2001,Kim Jong Il,"Improving officials’ practical abilities is the most urgent requirement of our Party and our revolution at present. In view of the situation and environment facing our revolution and the sacred revolutionary duty entrusted to our generation, it is impossible to make a victorious advance in the revolution and construction without radically improving officials’ political and professional qualifications. We are now making efforts to build a great, prosperous and powerful socialist nation and reunify the country in the midst of a complex and acute situation and under harsh conditions. The imperialist reactionaries are resorting to all conceivable schemes to suffocate our Republic and degenerate and undermine our socialism. Our revolutionary struggle and construction work are being conducted in acute confrontation with the imperialist reactionary forces on all fronts–political, military, economic and cultural. We should overpower the imperialist reactionary forces on all fronts and frustrate the enemy’s schemes to undermine and invade our country. Our revolution and construction have entered the 21st century. This new century will be an era of great changes, during which the world people’s struggle for independence has entered a new and 206 higher stage, and science and technology, including IT, develop apace to bring about a historic upturn in all sectors of social life. We should conduct our revolutionary struggle and construction work in keeping with the trend of the 21st century, and build a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country that measures up to the standards of the new century. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to approach all problems with a fresh point of view and resolve them on a new and higher level creatively and in our own way. We should effect continuous innovations and make a leap forward in all fields of the revolution and construction. Our struggle to build a great, prosperous and powerful country and reunify our nation is a great revolutionary drive and grand construction work that is unprecedented in history in view of its complexity and fierceness and the scale and depth of social and economic changes involved. In the new era of the Juche revolution our Party has launched a grand revolutionary drive and construction work, and is leading its whole membership, the entire army and all the people along the road of victory. All our cadres, Party members and other working people should cherish deep in their minds boundless pride and self-respect in carrying out the great revolutionary drive and construction work under the leadership of the Party, and support the Party’s ideas and leadership with loyalty, firmly united behind it with a single mind and will. Today our revolution, which is making a victorious advance weathering all sorts of storms under the leadership of the Party, demands that our cadres and other officials become ones who are unfailingly loyal to the Party, strong in ideas and faith and possessed of profound knowledge and high abilities. As President Kim Il Sung said, cadres decide everything. It is cadres that design, arrange and guide all work under the leadership of the Party, and it is also cadres that rally the masses around the Party and the leader and mobilize them to implement the Party’s policies. Success in any work is dependent on how cadres, the leading personnel of the revolution, support the Party’s ideas and leadership and how they work. 207 The present preparedness of our officials is not keeping in step with the demands of the Party, the revolution and the developing situation. They all make painstaking efforts to implement the Party’s intentions and policies, but few of them organize their work in such a way as to achieve the best results as intended by the Party. This is mainly attributable to their low level of practical abilities. The revolution has advanced onto a new and higher stage with the change of the times, but officials have not yet rid themselves of outdated viewpoints and methods of work. Their practical abilities are very low as compared with those demanded by the Party and the revolution, and, worse still, little emphasis is put on improving their practical abilities. It is imperative to drastically improve officials’ practical abilities. Practical abilities precisely mean creative abilities. Man transforms the world by dint of his ideological consciousness of independence and creative ability; a man who engages in revolution can be successful in his work only when he possesses both revolutionary ideological consciousness and high practical abilities. Everyone works as much as he or she knows and is capable of. Nobody can do anything properly and achieve good results in his or her work only with his or her subjective desire and enthusiasm. Those who lack knowledge and capability are apt to wield their authority in a bureaucratic manner, and deal with the tasks assigned to them without any clear-cut method or scientific calculation, thus making a mess of them. Ideological confidence and will which are not firmly supported by scientific knowledge and capability may waver and give way to defeatism, passivism and conservatism in the face of trials. Officials, to prove themselves worthy of the Party’s trust, should support it not with words only but by virtue of their practical abilities. Those who lack practical abilities cannot be truly faithful to the Party. All the officials should keep in mind that improving their practical abilities is a pressing requirement of the Party and the revolution, and make strenuous efforts to steadily improve their qualifications and standards. They should learn hard under the slogan “Let’s support the 208 Party by virtue of practical abilities!” in order to improve their creative abilities. Above all, they should firmly equip themselves with the Party’s ideas, intentions, lines and policies. Our Party is leading the revolutionary struggle and construction work in accordance with its original ideas and theories, strategies and tactics, and revolutionary lines and policies. The Party’s lines and policies with regard to all fields–Party building, army building, economic and cultural construction, national reunification and foreign relations–are clear-cut, and so are the ways of carrying out the revolutionary tasks and the working methods. It has advanced new policies in keeping with the requirements of the developing reality in each period and at each stage of the revolution, and energetically led the efforts for their implementation. Officials can deal with any complex problem in a proficient manner and accomplish any difficult task if they are firmly equipped with the Party’s lines and policies and work in conformity with its ideas and intentions. The point is whether our officials are well aware of the Party’s ideas and intentions and its lines and policies and whether they correctly apply them in their work. Now our officials say that they strive to implement the Party’s policies in support of its ideas and leadership, but in many cases their understanding of the Party’s ideas and policies is quite superficial, shallow and pedestrian. Incorporated into the Party’s lines and policies are our philosophy of revolution and politics, profound principles and theories of the revolution and construction, and the Party’s plans and intentions. If they learn the Party’s policies by rote and approach them in an unimaginative manner without making a deep study of them ideologically and theoretically, officials cannot grasp the essence of the Party’s policies, nor can they gain a comprehensive and profound understanding of their contents. Then they cannot make the Party’s ideas and policies an integral part of their thoughts and accept them as their faith, nor can they champion and implement them. It is of decisive importance for officials to equip themselves with the Party’s ideas, 209 intentions, lines and policies. Officials should make a deep study of the Party’s lines and policies ideologically and theoretically. They should refrain from simply learning them by rote and approaching them in a pedestrian manner. The lines and policies advanced by the Party reflect its ideas and theories, which illuminate the path of the revolution and construction, and represent its plans and intentions. The main thing is for officials to acquire a profound knowledge of the Party’s ideas, theories, plans and intentions, which are incorporated into its policies, for without doing so they cannot say that they have understood the policies, nor can they implement them properly. Officials should have a correct understanding of the Party’s policies by studying them ideologically and theoretically before they undertake any organizational or political work for implementing the policies, and take technical and practical measures to this end. Officials should make a deep study of the Party’s policies with a correct viewpoint, stand and attitude towards them, and implement them properly without any deviation. In order for officials to have a mastery of the Party’s lines and policies it is necessary for them to firmly equip themselves with the Juche idea, the guiding idea of the Party. All the lines and policies advanced by our Party are based on the Juche idea and imbued with the idea, theory and method of Juche. The works of President Kim Il Sung and the Party’s literature reflect and crystallize in a comprehensive and profound way the fundamentals of the Juche idea and the ideas and theories with regard to all fields of the revolution and construction. Officials should make a systematic study of these works and literature on a regular basis to enhance their ideological and theoretical levels. Then they can master the Party’s lines and policies ideologically and theoretically, and organize all undertakings in conformity with the Party’s ideas and intentions and the requirements of its policies. Officials should be well versed in modern science and technology. The present is an era of science and technology, the IT industry 210 era. Today science and technology, including IT, are developing rapidly on a worldwide scale, and their role in all fields of social and economic life is increasing with each passing day. We cannot undertake anything separate from modern science and technology, nor can we build a great, prosperous and powerful country without rapidly developing science and technology. Gone are the days when officials worked with outdated knowledge or only with their own limited experience. In the present era the main thing for officials is to equip themselves with the Party’s ideas, intentions, lines and policies. This is their primary qualification; knowledge of modern science and technology is their secondary qualification. Our officials should strive to obtain a profound knowledge of science and technology, and learn IT and how to work with computers in keeping with the trend of the IT industry era and the requirements for the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country. They should keep themselves abreast of the world trends in science and technology, and have a general knowledge of cutting-edge science and technology. Particularly those in the economic sector should endeavour to learn the latest science and technology and steadily improve their scientific and technological levels, keeping in mind the fact that they cannot do their work properly without mastering modern science and technology. Also, Party officials should be well versed in science and technology to be efficient in the work with people, the core of Party work, and in the Party-oriented guidance of administrative and economic affairs. All our officials should train themselves to be knowledgeable and competent, well versed in modern science and technology, true to the Party’s idea of attaching importance to science and technology. Officials should become experts in their respective fields and acquire multifaceted knowledge. Only when they possess political and practical qualifications appropriate to their fields can officials fulfil their responsibility and role at the revolutionary posts entrusted to them by the Party. For this 211 purpose, it is necessary for them to be well versed in the Party’s policies, have a wide knowledge of science and technology, be capable of handling their tasks properly, and know their respective jobs inside out. They should be prepared in such a way that there is nothing beyond their comprehension and capability in their respective fields. Officials should also have a mastery of a broad range of knowledge–political, economic and cultural. In particular, they should learn military knowledge, direct great concern to military affairs and keep themselves abreast of the developments in and outside the country as demanded by the Songun era. They should learn art and literature, and improve their cultural and spiritual attainments. Wide knowledge and rich spiritual attainments enable them to grasp reality in breadth and depth, launch their work in a proactive and creative manner, and possess noble human virtues. All officials should strive to acquire multifaceted knowledge and improve their general cultural level. Developing organizing ability is very important for officials in improving their practical abilities. Officials’ ideological and theoretical standards and technical and professional qualifications find expression in practice–planning, arranging and organizing their work. Theory and knowledge are not all that are demanded for high practical abilities. Officials who are not prepared ideologically and theoretically and have poor knowledge or desk-bound officials who falsely claim to be knowledgeable cannot prove themselves efficient in practice. Our officials, while steadily improving their ideological and theoretical standards and technical and professional qualifications, should develop their organizing ability through dealing with real situations. In order for officials to become proficient in organizing undertakings, they should master our Party’s revolutionary working methods, which are Juche-oriented, and learn the leadership art of our own style. Officials should master and apply in a proper way our Party’s 212 revolutionary working methods, like planning, arranging and organizing all undertakings on the principle of selecting their right seeds and ensuring their cost effectiveness, coping with changeable circumstances in a proactive and adroit way while strictly adhering to the revolutionary principles and conducting all undertakings creatively in conformity with the environment, conditions and actual situation. At the same time they should give priority to the main link in the whole chain to make a breakthrough in improving the work as a whole and tackling the tasks in such a way as to complete one before going on to another, and press on with all tasks to their completion. Important among officials’ abilities is the one of understanding the masses and enlisting their courage and wisdom. There is no obstacle insurmountable and no task impossible when officials trust and rely on the masses, and encourage them to give full play to their revolutionary enthusiasm and creative abilities. Our officials should mingle with the masses, sharing weal and woe with them and teaching and learning from them, and become their intimate friends and devoted servants. All the officials of Party organizations and administrative and economic organs should possess the abilities of motivating the masses politically, rallying them and enlisting their inexhaustible creative strength. The basic ways of improving officials’ practical abilities are studying and revolutionary practice. There is no such thing as inborn practical abilities, nor is there any royal road to improving practical abilities. Officials’ practical abilities are not determined by their age or length of service. They can acquire high abilities only by assiduous and sincere study and revolutionary practice. Officials should launch an intensive drive to improve their practical abilities through study and practice. As there is no limit to man’s creative ability, they should conduct such a drive not as a crash campaign, but as a longterm project. They should study hard with a correct viewpoint. The viewpoint that studying is the primary duty of revolutionaries is not firm among many officials now, so they do not study hard on one excuse or 213 another. It is important, above all else, for officials to have a correct viewpoint of and attitude to studying. The anti-Japanese guerrillas studied with painstaking efforts in severe circumstances, true to their Commander Kim Il Sung’s instructions. There are no conditions or reasons dictating that our officials not study hard. All officials should study every day, keeping in mind that if they are lax about study, they cannot perform their duty, and, in the long run, they may lose the eligibility for their jobs. Everyone, irrespective of the level of knowledge, university degree, age, career, position and merit, should study hard. Formalistic study should be eradicated. Studying should be aimed, to all intents and purposes, at acquiring workable knowledge, the nourishment for making a revolution. Officials should study in such an effective way as to grasp the essence and principles of things and phenomena. Then they can acquire workable knowledge and improve their practical abilities through studying. In order to intensify study among officials and enhance its qualitative level, it is necessary to get rid of formalism in organizing and guiding study by officials. Party organizations have not yet rid themselves of the stereotyped forms and patterns in organizing and guiding study by officials; they tend to give precedence to the form of study over its content and quality. If study is not organized and guided effectively on a high level, it will be impossible to eradicate formalism, and, worse still, may result in encouraging it among officials. In addition, senior officials’ viewpoint of and attitude to study has a great impact on their juniors. Senior officials should try to learn more and study harder, and make exacting demands upon their juniors. If they do not study hard themselves and pay no heed to their juniors’ methods of studying while organizing work at random and nagging their juniors into being concerned about trifles claiming that immediate tasks are the main thing, it will be impossible to intensify study and establish a proper habit of studying among officials. Party organizations should be bold in eradicating the outmoded 214 patterns in guiding study by officials as demanded by the new era, the new century. They should make innovations in this regard, and senior officials at all units should be exemplary in studying and pay primary attention to it, making exacting demands upon their juniors and helping them with their studying. In this way, they should establish a revolutionary habit of studying throughout the Party and society, and bring about a fresh upturn in studying by officials. Officials should improve their practical abilities in the course of carrying out their revolutionary tasks. Practice is an effective way of verifying and consolidating knowledge gained by studying and improving practical abilities. The officials’ working capability is the ability with which to apply their ideological theories and scientific and technological knowledge to practical uses. It is only through self-conscious and purposeful revolutionary practice that they can apply their theories and knowledge to their work and improve their working capability. Officials should always strive to improve their work. Thinking and exploring are the qualities indispensable for officials in both studying and practice. Those lazy in thinking and exploring will end up with rusty brains and make little progress in their practical activities. Only when they put their heart and soul into carrying out the revolutionary tasks and delve deeply into their work can officials discover the right methodology, pick up splendid ideas and possess the revolutionary traits of working out an ambitious plan and forcefully pushing ahead with it. They should, through profound thinking and exploring, make detailed arrangements and calculations and discover the right method before applying it confidently and in a proactive manner. They should also make it a habit and part of life’s routine to review their work every day so as to rectify shortcomings in time, accumulate experiences and learn lessons. The issue of officials’ practical abilities is not merely a technical matter but one related to their ideas and loyalty to the Party and the leader. How hard officials strive to improve their practical abilities 215 depends on their ideas. Those who are strong in idea will be zealous in studying, and those who are not will become idlers. Those who try to be truly faithful to the Party and the leader cannot but strive to improve their practical abilities. Though improving their practical abilities at present is the most urgent requirement, some officials do not try to study hard. This is an expression of expediency and indolence, which shows that their professed loyalty to the Party is not sincere. The height of one’s ideas and loyalty is the height of one’s practical abilities and achievements. Kim Chaek, who left an indelible trace in the history of our revolution, is worthy of being considered the archetype of a communist revolutionary, as he supported the Party and the leader with unfailing loyalty and practical abilities, and made brilliant achievements in his career. Although he did not have any university degree, nor did he learn economics and technology, this fighter strong in idea and faith and loyal to his leader with firm trust in the latter, worked hard in and outside work to equip himself with the Party’s ideas and policies and acquire a wide range of knowledge in the complex and difficult circumstances after the liberation of the country. Thus he carried out splendidly all the tasks entrusted to him by the leader. Today, too, the officials who are loyal to the Party and the leader have a strong desire for studying and are making considerable achievements in their work by virtue of their practical abilities. The torch of Ranam could flare up as a torch of great upsurge because the workers, technicians and officials at the Ranam Coal Mining Machine Complex displayed to the full the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and their practical abilities in hearty response to the Party’s call. Officials’ loyalty to the Party and the leader should be expressed not merely by words but by their efforts to improve their practical abilities and by achievements in their work. Our officials should do their utmost to make themselves reliable and competent men of the Party who possess the spirit of defending their leader and implementing his instructions even unto death and 216 who carry out gloriously the revolutionary tasks given to them by the Party. Only when they possess intense loyalty and honesty will they try to their utmost to acquire workable knowledge. Officials should be sincere and passionate in learning with a single mind of loyalty to the Party and the leader and faithfulness to the Party’s cause, free from selfishness and affectation. In our country everyone who makes efforts is fully able to learn and improve his or her practical abilities. The most advantageous educational system has been established, a well-regulated studying system is available for officials and working people, and the Grand People’s Study House and other educational and cultural establishments have been set up to serve people in all parts of the country. Our Party provides every condition necessary for all the people to learn and cultivate their talents to their heart’s content, and especially encourages officials to study hard and improve their practical abilities, setting it as the primary requirement for them and an important policy of the Party and encouraging them to study. This is an expression of its great affection and care for officials and the other people which cannot be found elsewhere in the world. All the officials should endeavour to learn so as to prove themselves worthy of the Party’s affection and care. It is necessary to establish a habit of giving importance to practical abilities throughout the Party and society, and intensify the drive to improve them in all sectors. Officials who have distinguished themselves in promoting the prosperity of the country and improving the people’s living standards by displaying their practical abilities should be given social respect and prominence and high commendation. Educational institutions, including universities and cadre-training centres, should radically improve their quality of education and intensify studying among their students on the principle of giving first and foremost importance to the students’ academic achievements and their study habits. Universities and cadretraining centres should establish a strict order of admitting students and assigning the graduates to jobs according to their academic 217 achievements, and apply it to the letter. The sector of personnel administration, too, should evaluate officials and assign them to jobs on the basis of their qualifications. It is also important to direct close concern to reeducating the officials so as to systematically improve their qualifications. It is a policy of our Party to pave the way for the prosperity of the country by means of using everyone’s practical abilities, as it holds its ideology as the main thing. All our officials, cherishing the Party’s policy as part of their faith and will, should make redoubled efforts to improve their political and business levels and qualifications.

06.03.2002,Kim Jong Il,"We should conduct forest and water conservation vigorously as a nationwide and all-people drive in spring and autumn, the periods of general mobilization for land administration, and in the seasons suitable for planting trees. President Kim Il Sung, saying that forest and water conservation is an important part of the foundations of the country, made sure that great efforts were directed to preserving the rivers and forests after liberation. Soon after the country’s liberation he planted trees on Munsu Hill, and turned the first sod of the Pothong River improvement project. These signalled the start of a new history of forest and water conservation in our country. Under his wise leadership, our people effectively conducted forest and water conservation by covering with trees the mountains, which had been deforested by the plundering Japanese imperialists and scorched by US imperialist bombs, improving rivers and streams and spreading the irrigation network across the country. But our officials were not persistent with forest and water conservation, and as a consequence the number of trees on mountains 246 has gradually decreased, forests have deteriorated and rivers and streams have lost their beauty. Worse still, with the country’s economic situation getting more and more difficult owing to the isolate-and-suffocate schemes of the imperialists and severe natural calamities that hit the country for several consecutive years, some people cut trees at random and reclaimed hillsides for tillage. This led to many mountains and hills being stripped bare, and the beds of many rivers rising with the depositing of earth, sand and gravel. This is why, for some years now, I have underlined the importance of conserving forests and water at every opportunity, including during my field guidance. Since then, the work of planting trees and improving rivers and streams has been conducted vigorously, but the work of forest and water conservation is yet to reach the level demanded by the Party. The entire Party, the whole army and all the people should turn out as one to conduct forest and water conservation more vigorously. Forest and water conservation is a noble, patriotic work for people’s well-being and the country’s prosperity and an everlasting nature-transforming project. Our country has many mountains and rivers. Most mountains are stony and the soil is shallow. Moreover, the rivers are sharply inclined and their currents are swift. If they are not properly conserved, even a small amount of flooding or drought may cause damage. Only when mountains are thickly forested, rivers and streams are improved, and soil erosion control is effective can the land of the country be conserved, the lives and property of the people protected and the mountains and rivers become more beautiful and bountiful. From olden times, our country has been called a land of golden tapestry because its mountains and rivers are beautiful and it has abundant natural resources. We should turn this land on which our nation has lived through generations into a socialist earthly paradise, a beautiful land of the age of the Workers’ Party, which is beautiful and abundant in everything, by better conserving and sprucing them 247 up in our time. Such is the plan and determination of the Party at present in this respect. All Party organizations and officials, fully aware of the Party’s plan and intention, should conduct forest and water conservation properly, so as to bring about a fresh upsurge in building the country into a socialist earthly paradise, a beautiful land of the age of the Workers’ Party. Above all, great efforts should be made to plant trees and take care of them. Forests are precious resources of the country and a valuable asset for the prosperity of the country and happiness of the people. It is only when we plant trees in great numbers and thus create thick forests that we can increase the natural resources of the country, transform the appearance of the land and provide the people with excellent living conditions and environment. President Kim Il Sung said long ago that mountainous regions should exploit mountains properly. What he meant is that forests should be created in mountainous areas to make effective use of them in developing the economy and improving the people’s standard of living. If forests are created widely and they are put into effective use in our country, a large area of whose territory is mountainous, many problems can be solved in developing the country’s economy and improving the people’s standard of living. Our Party has advanced a policy of covering the whole country with forests and flowers by launching forest planting in a fresh way from the 2000s. We should implement the Party’s policy to the letter and thus cover the mountains across the country with green forests in the same way as is shown in the feature film Forests Sway. The most important thing in covering the whole country with forests is to plant trees of superior kinds. At present, many mountains are sparsely covered with trees, and even if they are covered with vegetation this is mainly shrubs and such crooked trees as pine trees which cannot be used as timber. Even though there are a large number of such trees, they cannot bring great 248 economic benefit. If we cut down such trees and plant trees of superior kinds in their places, we can enjoy their benefit 10 or 20 years later. Man must conquer nature; he must not become its slave. Indiscriminate felling ruined many forests in the days of the Arduous March. If the trees felled then were of inferior kinds, then it is not a loss. We should plant trees of superior kinds in large numbers in their places in order to turn the misfortune into a blessing. The kinds of the trees should be improved in conformity with the realities of the present era. When I visit famous forests and old trees in various places, including scenic spots and historical sites, the guides say proudly that this tree was planted in the days of Koryo and that tree was planted in the days of the Ri Dynasty, in addition to extolling the superiority of those trees. It is a similar case with other countries. We should select and plant good species in reflection of the features of our era, the Juche era. In our country there are many useful species of trees, such as larch, acacia, poplar, pine-nut and ginkgo. We should plant these trees in large numbers so that they can make practical contributions to the prosperity of the country and the nation. We should create forests for obtaining timber, fibre, oil and fruits in order to hand down to posterity mountains which are thickly forested and which produce “treasure.” In other words, one must live not merely for today but for tomorrow. When conducting the work of planting forests and covering the whole country with forests and flowers, we should do it with a long-term plan for the coming generations, with an eye to the distant future. Varieties of trees should not be designated at random for planting on the plea that trees of useful varieties are being given priority. Biological features vary according to the varieties of trees, and climatic and natural features vary according to areas. Many of the mountains in our country are stony and the soil is shallow. They are also acidified because many coniferous trees have grown there for a long time. Trees, however good the varieties are, should not be planted at random. As the principle of sowing the right crop on the 249 right soil is observed in farming, the principle of planting the right tree on the right soil should be observed in planting trees. Acacia is most suitable to barren and acidified land. It is very good for protecting the environment, grows fast and is tenacious. Because its roots have a bacterium that assimilates atmospheric nitrogen, it grows well even on barren land, and a thick forest of acacias may be formed in a few years. The tree is good not only for enriching the soil but for protecting it from being acidified. It can be used as firewood and as a material for construction and furniture making as well, because the wood is hard and highly resistant to moisture. It is counted as a tree of a good variety worldwide because it is favourable for beekeeping for the high content of pollen in its flowers. The tree is useful for breeding such domestic animals as goats, sheep and rabbits, because it is not infested with insects and its leaves contain much protein. I am told that thornless acacia, which is being planted in our country in recent years, grows fast and is good for timber production and as a roadside tree. If the lower part of the tree is trimmed and the upper part is made in the shape of an umbrella, it will be pleasing to the eye. We should spread the thornless acacia widely. Recently I have stressed on several occasions that acacias should be planted on a large scale. We should inform cadres, Party members and other working people of the Party’s intention of making the acacia a tree of Korea so as to ensure that the entire Party, the whole nation and all the people rise up to plant and cultivate the tree. Trees of inferior varieties in the recreation grounds and along the roads should be replaced with superior varieties. As I said previously, the trees on Mt Taesong are not diverse in variety, and their species are not good, either. Most of the trees growing on the southern slope of the mountain with a recreation ground are pine trees, which do not grow tall. Dwarf-pine trees and other varieties that do not grow tall and are inferior should be replaced with superior varieties. We should replace the trees on Mt Taesong with trees of superior varieties so as to enhance its beauty. 250 The mountains along the road to Kangdong are also covered mainly with dwarf-pine trees; they should also be replaced with superior varieties as suited to the local features. Pine trees remain crooked even after scores of years, so it is advisable to leave those trees in certain historical places, like Mangyongdae, Ponghwa-ri, Mausoleum of King Tongmyong and Mt Kumgang, and replace those in other places with other varieties gradually. When planting trees along the roads, the varieties should be designated according to the nature of the roads and their surroundings. Fruit trees should be planted in the hills near villages and around the houses in the countryside. At the moment, we cannot find many fruit trees around the houses in the rural areas. In the past, I would hear such expressions as “pear-tree house,” “house in front of a pear tree” and “house at the back of a pear tree,” but it is difficult to hear such expressions these days. We should make sure that fruit trees are planted in the yards of the rural houses so that these expressions are revived. If fruit trees are planted in the yard of a rural house, they are useful in various ways; they are pleasant to the eye, the family can eat the fruits, and farmers can take a rest in their shade after field work in the sweltering summer days. President Kim Il Sung said that each rural household should plant five or more fruit trees around the house, and the whole countryside should unfold a campaign to plant fruit trees around houses. When a house is built in the countryside, five or more fruit trees should be planted around the house without fail. Chestnut trees should be planted in great numbers at the feet of mountains. At the moment the number of these trees is small because they were not taken good care of in the past. From olden times the Songchon Chestnut and Kumya Large Chestnut have been famous in our country. Previously, the Youth League planted chestnut trees and took good care of them, designating groups of them Children’s Union forests and LSWYK forests, but now it seems it is not organizing the work properly. President Kim Il Sung said on several occasions that roasted sweet potatoes and chestnuts should be sold in many places in 251 Pyongyang. But now it seems that there is no place that sells roasted chestnuts there. Chestnut trees should be planted in great numbers so that roasted chestnuts can be sold in various parts of Pyongyang. Trees should be planted in an effective way. Among the trees that were planted, there are many that have died because they were not planted with the care demanded by the technical regulations. Among the trees planted in spring, some might die or some might be unpleasing to the eye; those trees should be replaced in autumn. But this is not the case now. We should not merely pay lip-service to planting trees, but conduct the work in a scrupulous way. Every tree should be planted with care by digging a hole for it as required by the technical regulations and watering it conscientiously. Needle-leaved trees and broad-leaved trees should be planted in combination in planting trees and creating forests. Then, the trees grow well and the soil can be protected from being acidified. When planting trees in the mountains, they should be planted densely. If young trees are planted sparsely, forests cannot be created in a short period of time. Densely planted trees can be thinned out after they have grown to a certain height. When transplanting seedlings, those that are too young should not be transplanted. If seedlings are grown to a certain height for some years in nurseries and transplanted, they will grow quickly, creating thick forests and bringing benefit to us in a few years. In order to cover the whole country with trees at the earliest date, we should solve the problem of seeds and seedlings. As this is an important problem, the Party has taken measures for importing seeds and seedlings of trees of superior varieties and stopping export of tree seeds like pine nuts, which conform to our country’s climatic and natural features. The tree seeds necessary for covering the whole country with trees should be put under the control and management of the Ministry of Land and Environment Protection to be used for the production of tree seedlings. Seeds and seedlings of trees that are said to be superior worldwide should be imported to be spread across the country. 252 Nurseries should be built well and produce healthy seedlings. Producing seedlings is the first stage in covering the whole country with trees. Though there are nurseries in cities, counties and several other units now, they are not fully meeting the demands for seedlings. This being the situation, some units, when they are told to plant trees in treeplanting seasons, transplant the trees from the mountains. It should not be done in that way. If the trees die after transplantation, it will do more harm than good. Tree-planting should be done by way of cultivating tree seedlings of superior varieties in nurseries and transplanting them. Provinces, cities, counties and other relevant units should build up nurseries and produce healthy seedlings in large numbers by cultivating them properly in accordance with the Party’s policy of covering the whole country with trees. While creating forests on an extensive scale by planting many trees, we should protect and tend the forests with care. Above all else, the newly-planted trees should be cultivated well. After planting them, we should direct constant attention to them, manuring and watering them and clearing grass and shrubs from around them. In the places dense with grass and shrubs, young trees, including those that demand sunlight, may die or be prevented from growing properly. The practice of felling trees at random should be eliminated. Such a practice is an illegal act that damages precious assets of the country and the people. A strong discipline and order should be established whereby even one tree may only be felled after the approval of the organ concerned is obtained and may only be felled in the place approved. Young trees must never be felled. Only mature trees should be felled, for if they are not cut down, their trunks get hollow and they become useless. By forest conservation, we do not mean purposeless forest conservation. As President Kim Il Sung said, the principle of planting ten trees after felling one tree should be observed strictly. In order to eliminate the practice of felling trees indiscriminately, the problem of fuel should be solved by creating large areas of 253 firewood forests. The decrease of the number of trees in mountains in recent years is related, to a considerable extent, to the fact that the people were not supplied with fuel in sufficient amounts. Every cooperative farm has its own forest of more than one hundred hectares, but this has not proven its real worth as a result of poor management. Cooperative farms should solve the problems of farming materials and firewood of the farmers by creating and managing their forests in a proper way. I have already given instructions that the land administration sector should create firewood forests of 600 000 hectares and the forestry sector 200 000 hectares– 800 000 hectares in all; this work should be carried out with persistence. In addition, measures for solving the problem of coal for civilian use should be taken. Provinces, cities, counties, factories, enterprises and cooperative farms should manage their own coal mines effectively. In this way we can decisively solve the problem of fuel for the people. Without providing the people with sufficient amounts of fuel it will be of no avail to call upon them to protect forests and not to fell trees. The most important thing in conserving forests is to prevent forest fires. Party and working people’s organizations should conduct the educational work for preventing forest fires among their members in an effective way, while the organs of land conservation and administration should strengthen surveillance and control over forest fires so as to ensure that the precious mountains of our country are not ravaged by forest fires. Forestry science should be developed for covering the whole country with trees. This is an era of science and technology, so the work of planting trees and creating forests can achieve success only when it relies on science and technology. In the past, our officials paid little attention to developing forestry science; as a consequence, the science of forestry in our country is behind the other branches of science. Forestry science research institutions and botanical gardens should be built up and their role enhanced for a fresh upsurge in forestry 254 science. As solving the seed problem is the main thing in the field of agricultural, stockbreeding and fish-farming sciences, so it is in the field of forestry science. Efforts should be made to develop varieties of trees which have economic value and are suitable to the climatic and natural features of our country, and spread them quickly. In order to cover the whole country with forests, it is important not only to plant trees in large numbers but to make them grow quickly. So, studies are needed to this end. There may also be many problems to solve in creating and managing forests. Botanical gardens should cultivate the trees sent by the Party, including all kinds of fruit trees, in a scientific way, study methods of raising various trees and conduct vigorously the work of spreading the seedlings of trees of superior varieties throughout the country by producing them in large numbers. For this, competent botanists should be assigned to the botanical gardens in the capital and provinces, and a proper work system should be established for the botanical gardens. Rivers and streams must be improved, and water should be used in an effective way. When mountains are stripped of trees, earth and sand trickle down from them if it rains, causing landslides and a great deal of deposits on riverbeds. Take the Chongchon for example. This river was deep in the past, but it has become so shallow that people can wade across it. The name of the river apparently meant that the water is clear and deep; now it has become shallow, its width narrowed at some points, and stones and sand exposed on the riverbed are not pleasing to the eye. If the river overflows in the present conditions, it may damage the nearby farmlands. At the same time as planting many trees on mountains, we should improve rivers, thus adding beauty to the scenery and preventing flood damage. Where necessary, river channels should be straightened, and embankments and retaining walls built. Bank-protecting tree belts should also be created and riverbeds dredged on a planned and regular basis. Afforestation for erosion control should be done in a 255 proper way to prevent earth and stones flowing into rivers and landslides, and facilities for protecting rivers should be kept in a good state of repair. Water resources should be protected and used in an effective way. Water is a precious asset of the country, as it is essential to man’s life. Not only man but also every other organism on the earth cannot live without water. Man must take water to live. He can live without oil, but not without water. But our people do not know how valuable water is. At present, water has become a serious problem throughout the world. I am told that the earth is drying up, probably because of crustal movements. From now on we should economize on water and protect water resources. Dams should be built on rivers and streams to conserve water for irrigation and industry, and for power plants and fish farms for the production of electricity and freshwater fish. Jongphyong County, South Hamgyong Province, is exemplary in controlling rivers and making effective use of water. In the past the county built several reservoirs and did farming by using water from them. Now the whole county is stepping up the construction of a large-scale dam across the Kumjin River, and the work is in the final stage. When the project is completed, thousands of kilowatts of electricity can be generated. If power stations are built in tiers downstream, they can produce more electricity than the county needs. In the past when the river flooded, the lower parts of Jongphyong County along the river were submerged. But when the project is completed, the county will become completely free from the threat of floods. The local people say that they will enjoy themselves singing the praises of the benevolence of the Party on a tour boat on the beautiful lake when the dam is built. We are putting great efforts into the Kaechon-Lake Thaesong waterway project, and it is nearing completion. In the past we built several dams on the Taedong River, thus turning it into a large lake and protecting the Taedong River basin, including Pyongyang, from floods. When the gravitational waterway project is completed, the 256 river will be used more effectively for the economic development of the country and the happy life of the people, and the local landscape will become more beautiful. Forest and water conservation should be conducted as an allpeople drive. As the scale of the tasks is enormous, they cannot be done by a few people in the field of land and environment conservation. All the people should turn out as one in the efforts to plant trees on mountains and fields and improve rivers. Moreover, as tree-planting should not miss the season, all sectors, all units and all people should be mobilized to plant trees in the tree-planting season. In this season soldiers as well as civilians should be enlisted to plant trees, and soldiers should take the lead in this drive as in other undertakings. Soldiers and civilians should pool their efforts and help each other to make the country and their living places more beautiful. All units in all fields of the national economy which are conducting the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement should conduct it in close combination with planting trees and improving rivers. During my field guidance I have found that many factories and enterprises have established a cultured way of production and living, but the mountains in their vicinities are only sparsely covered with trees. Apparently, our people’s view is one-sided. Tree planting should be a must for winning the Red Flag; the flag should not be conferred on those units that have failed to scale the target for tree planting. If forest and water conservation is to be conducted as an all-people drive, all Party members and other working people should be assimilated to socialist patriotism. Socialist patriotism is genuine patriotism which links love for the country with love for its socialist system. Socialist patriotism finds expression in loving every tree and every blade of grass in the socialist country, as well as loving one’s family, workplace and native place. Party and working people’s organizations should intensify ideological education and assimilate all the Party members and other working people to socialist patriots so that they will turn out as one to make their country, their motherland, 257 more prosperous and beautiful, cherishing ardent love for their socialist country. Success in forest and water conservation depends on the view and attitude senior officials of all sectors and units, including provinces, cities and counties, take when organizing and promoting this undertaking. They should improve the mountains and rivers in their respective areas with determination by formulating a bold and ambitious plan as required by the new century. They should make a detailed calculation of the areas to be planted with trees, the size of nurseries, the amount of labour needed, the number of rivers and streams to be improved and the kinds and amounts of the materials needed to improve them to implement the Party’s policy. They should draw up detailed plans on an annual basis and carry them out without fail. Forest and water conservation is a challenging and enormous undertaking, but it can surely be carried out if officials organize the work to the minutest detail and motivate the masses. Machinery and oil are needed in large amounts for improving the layout of the land, but they are not needed badly in planting trees on mountains. If officials, through efficient organizational work, have nurseries built, healthy tree seedlings grown and the seedlings transplanted by mobilizing the masses, this is all that is needed. The sense of responsibility and role of the Ministry of the Land and Environment Protection should be enhanced for a fresh upturn in forest and water conservation. The Ministry of the Land and Environment Protection has assumed before the Party and people the very important mission of guiding in a unified way land development and management and the protection and management of the resources and environment of the country. In its effort to intensify land and environment conservation, the Party had a ministry in charge of this field set up under the Cabinet. This ministry should undertake its work in a responsible way in line with the Party’s intention. What is most important here at the present time is to plant trees in large numbers, so it should vigorously push ahead with this true to the Party’s policy. 258 While formulating a long-term plan for overall land and environment conservation throughout the country and pushing it ahead vigorously, the ministry should guide its subordinate units and their officials to work in a responsible way. In particular, it should ensure that forest rangers protect the forests effectively. The forest and water conservation we are undertaking is significant not only for protecting the land and the people’s lives and property by merely planting trees on mountains and improving rivers and streams; it is an important undertaking to improve the appearances of the mountains and rivers of the country which were won back thanks to President Kim Il Sung as befit those of a socialist country both in name and in reality. While the land realignment, which is being vigorously pushed ahead in accordance with our Party’s far-sighted plan, is an undertaking to change the appearance of the land as befit that of socialist Korea, forest and water conservation is an undertaking to improve the appearances of mountains and rivers too as befit those of socialist Korea. If the appearances of mountains and rivers along with the land are improved as appropriate to a socialist country our motherland will become a truly beautiful socialist country which is good to live in. I expect that all the officials and other people will turn out as one during the period of general mobilization for land management and the tree-planting seasons and conduct the work of planting trees on mountains and improving rivers and streams vigorously holding up the slogan, “Let us make our own mountains, rivers and native places more beautiful!” thus bringing about a revolutionary upturn in

07.06.2002,Kim Jong Il,"South Hamgyong Province has many factories and enterprises, such as the mines in the Tanchon area, Ryongsong Machine Complex, February 8 Vinalon Complex and Hungnam Fertilizer Complex, which are of great significance for achieving the prosperity of the country and improving the people’s standard of living. Therefore, our Party has always paid close concern to the economic work in South Hamgyong Province. On this occasion, I am going to visit the Komdok Mine, Ryongyang Mine and Taehung Youth Mine to meet the miners there. I am also going to visit the Ryongsong Machine Complex as it has manufactured a new type of compressor and various other types of modern machines, true to the task I gave it during my field guidance last year. I plan to visit the cooperative farms in Pukchong County and other units as well. The Komdok Mine has built the monument to President Kim Il Sung’s on-the-spot guidance well. The large-scale mosaic mural is well portrayed. The area around the concourse is green with trees and grass. In fact, it is difficult to get a bearing as the Komdok 260 Revolutionary Museum is covered with greenery. It is good that the mine has opened the revolutionary museum to the public on a regular basis so as to educate the Party members and other working people. The number of seats in the Workers’ Hall of Culture, 1 000, is appropriate to its mission. It is encouraging that the lead and zinc deposits in the Komdok Mine amount, in their contents, to tens of millions of tons. The mine is a world-class base for producing nonferrous ore. It can be said figuratively that the mine is sitting on lumps of gold. Recently the mine has repaired its equipment and put production on a normal footing. It is laudable that it fulfilled the production quota for May despite the insufficient supply of electricity. It has secured ore reserves two times greater than that required by the state policy through prospecting, preparatory tunnelling and excavation. This is a great success. The miners have laid firm foundations for bringing about a fresh upturn in ore production by displaying patriotic devotion and mass heroism. It is laudable that a marker of the President’s on-the-spot guidance was erected at ore-dressing plant No. 3. The President gave field guidance on two occasions at this plant located on a high and rugged mountain. Since the inauguration of the plant, the mine has earned large sums of foreign exchange, rendering contributions to developing the national economy and improving the people’s standard of living. Ore transportation and the crushing, grinding and dressing lines in this plant are similar to those of the Musan Mining Complex. The large crushers have been taken good care of. Though they are equipment for crushing rocks, they are quite clean. It is praiseworthy that not even a bolt or nut was lost from the equipment of the crushing workshop in the period of the Arduous March. As many trees have been planted along the road from the crushing workshop to the grinding workshop, I felt as if I were walking in a park. You say that the flotation workshop is 250 metres long. It is really a “sea of machinery.” As our people have built a Jucheoriented, independent national economy enduring all hardships under 261 the leadership of the Party and the leader, we were able to construct this gigantic structure. People generally regard coal and ore mines as dirty places, but ore dressing plant No. 3 is so clean that it does not look like a place that handles rocks. The plant has managed the equipment well and planted many trees around it. It has established a cultured way of production. You should make efforts to manage and run the plant in a more effective way. The July 1 Youth Station of the April 5 Pit at the Kumgol SubMine looks like a palace. I cannot imagine its original appearance. The entrance to the pit reminds me of my visit here in 1975. At that time, the entrance was not as big as it is now. The mine is planning to enlarge the pit to excavate the ore by drill jumbo and transport it by trucks. For a sharp increase in ore production, the Party’s policy of realizing mass extraction, mass transportation and mass processing while giving top priority to prospecting and tunnelling should be carried out to the letter. Mining Workteam No. 3 of the April 5 Pit is working faithfully. This workteam was organized involving those who were born in 1961, the year President Kim Il Sung gave field guidance at the mine. Many of the members of the workteam have become heroes and the workteam a Hero Workteam. Laudable are the workteam members who have taken up jobs following in the footsteps of their parents. They are now 41 years old, and they have grown up as the qualified masters and hard core of the mine. You say that many workteams are growing to be hero workteams, like Mining Workteam No. 4 of the April 5 Pit, which was organized with those who were born in 1975, the year I visited the mine. They are the very hard core of our Party and the pillar of the mine. The sons and daughters of the heroic miners of Mining Workteam No. 3 of the April 5 Pit are studying at Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School. It is laudable that the workteam fulfilled this year’s plan by May 23. I am concerned whether they overworked themselves to fulfil this year’s plan ahead of schedule. What is important in increasing production is to introduce new, advanced 262 science and technology. In the 1960s newspapers and magazines highly praised the miners for working by sheer human strength without coming out of the pits, writing that there is no fixed capacity, and what is essential is one’s ideas. Today, in the 21st century, it will not do to work in the old way, disregarding science and technology. We should be proactive in introducing the latest achievements of science and technology to make labour easier and boost production continuously. The leader of Mining Workteam No. 3 has said that he will contribute to the improvement of the people’s standard of living by producing more nonferrous ore. I hope his determination will come true. I would like to invite the members of Mining Workteam No. 3 to Pyongyang to enjoy the mass gymnastics and artistic performance Arirang. This is a commendation I extend to them. When they are in Pyongyang, a party should be arranged at the Chongnyu Restaurant in their honour, and visits to the major sights and other places in Pyongyang should be organized for them. A senior official of the Party Central Committee should attend the party. This will inspire them to further efforts. You say that you can normalize production at the mine at a high level if 30 per cent of the earnings of the mine is invested. The initial investment may be larger than that. But, after production is put on a normal track, 30 per cent will be enough. The 30 per cent of the earnings of the mine should be provided to the mine without fail, so that it can use it for putting its production on a normal footing. Tailings must be treated before being discharged into rivers. Environment will be polluted if tailings are discharged into rivers without being treated properly. It is commendable that the Komdok Mine built a tailings treatment workshop. As planned, you should import a high-pressure pump in order to treat tailings properly. In future it will be necessary to raise the extraction rate of zinc through second and third flotation. I was told that all the re-flotation plants run by South Hamgyong Province had been removed. As the province is in charge of the mine, the province should be allowed to operate them to earn foreign exchange, as in the past. However, other 263 units must not be allowed to do so. Previously, the province had built a smeltery to produce zinc, but gave up production half-way. It should operate it again to contribute to improving the local people’s standard of living. The Party committee of the Komdok Mine should ensure effective supply service for the miners. President Kim Il Sung said that supply service work is political work. You should not think only about buying food with foreign exchange to improve the supply service work for the miners; you should make efforts to run your sideline agro-stock farm efficiently. The agro-stock farm should cultivate beans and maize, and raise domestic animals to provide the miners with soy sauce, bean paste and meat on a regular basis. The Party committee of the mine should always pay as close attention to improving supply service for the miners as it does to production. The Taehung Youth Mine is located in a mountainous area. Apparently, this is the highest of the places where our workers work. The mine is a world-class one in terms of the quality of magnesite ore deposited here and the mining conditions. The mine has rich deposits of various mineral resources, like arsenious anhydride and chlorite, as well as magnesite. The mine lies literally on piles of ore, piles of money. The mine should focus its efforts on developing itself, as it has bright prospects. It will be difficult for the mine to do everything on its own, so the state should concentrate investment on the mine, and the Cabinet should help it effectively. The mine has so far experienced difficulty in production because of improper catching of water at chute No. 1, the main link in the whole chain of production at the mine, but it is encouraging to learn that the project of catching water will be completed by June for normal operation of the chute. If the mine is run at full capacity, it will prove its worth. In future we should accelerate the development of the mine and boost ore production continuously. The Ryongyang Mine is a world-class magnesite mine. The mine has set up a monument in memory of President Kim Il Sung’s 264 guidance on April 5, 1961. The miners and officials of the mine, true to the President’s field guidance instructions, achieved many successes in the past. I highly appreciate the mine for having established a firm basis for rapid increases in mineral production by confirming sufficient amounts of magnesite to be extracted and giving precedence to pit construction. The prospects of this mine’s development are great. The mine has deposits of billions of tons of magnesite ore and other kinds of mineral resources. President Kim Il Sung was correct when he said that this rocky mountain here is a mountain of gold and treasure. If the mine can normalize its production at a high level it will greatly help the country. You should manage the mine well so as to add brilliance to the saying of the President, who also called the mine a “mountain of white gold.” The mine should direct primary attention to developing the ore body in the northern area. The quality of magnesite ore is evaluated by dividing it into four grades; the ore body in the northern area seems to be of very high grade. It is wonderful that the ore body has high-grade ore deposits amounting to millions of tons, as long as several hundred metres. You say that the mine plans to build a largescale stope in the pit which is different from the former method, so as to extract the ore in the northern area by excavators, transport it by heavy-duty trucks and treat it at the sieving plant. It is good that you are to develop the ore body in the northern area and that you plan to implement mass extraction, mass transportation and mass treatment. It is the Party’s requirement to extract ore in a big way and in a modern fashion. The Ryongyang Mine should actively realize extracting the ore body in the northern area in a big way and in a modern fashion. The mine should submit for supply everything it thinks necessary for developing the ore body in the northern area. Officials of the mine should take everything into full consideration based on the achievements of the latest science and technology as required by the present age of science and technology. They should build large-sized pits and ceaselessly improve the mining equipment 265 so as to mine the magnesite ore in other areas by means of mass extraction, mass transportation and mass treatment, just as they plan to do with the ore body in the northern area. I am told that the mine plans to bring large excavators and trucks up to Mt Sohyang and build 2.5-kilometre-long conveyor belt in order to extract ore and transport it in large quantities. The problem will be the construction of a chute. Though you say that you can build the chute in a short period because you have the experience of having built one for developing the western vein, you may face various technical problems. I am more interested in developing the ore body in the northern area than in developing the vein on Mt Sohyang. I have seen good things in the Ryongyang Mine. The mine management requests that discharged soldiers be sent to the mine. I will see to this. However, you should not resort to humanwave tactics, and neglect to renovate the technology. The motivational worker of the workteam of excavator No. 7 at the Kumsan Pit is to be praised, as she volunteered to work in the mine from Pyongyang after seeing the TV series Mountain of White Gold. The Party designated the Phogo Cooperative Farm in Tanchon as a sideline agro-stock farm of the Ryongyang Mine in the period of the Arduous March and forced march. Last year the mine fulfilled the plan of supplying meat and liquor to the miners by producing them with the grain harvested in the farm and is supplying them with meat and liquor on a regular basis this year as well. It has even built a supply store for merited workers. The mine also plans to raise a great number of goats in order to supply goat’s milk every day to the miners working in the pits. The Komdok, Ryongyang and other mines in the Tanchon area should work harder. As the mines are as good as lying on piles of gold, they should be provided with sufficient conditions for production and guided properly for steady increases in their production. In particular, they should be provided with enough electricity. In the present circumstances they can boost production sharply if only they are 266 provided with enough electricity. The Tanchon Smeltery and the Tanchon Magnesia Factory are not operating at full capacity for lack of electricity even though zinc concentrate and magnesite ore are available. The whole amount of electricity produced by generator No. 1 of the Hochongang Power Station should be sent to the Tanchon area, and the Cabinet should supervise and control the process. The structure of the superior organ should be readjusted for unified guidance to the mines, the smeltery and the magnesia factory in the Tanchon area, and the organ should guide them in an effective way. Party guidance to the mines in the Tanchon area should be conducted in a proper way, appropriate to the Party, not simply by taking over their administrative and economic affairs. In essence, a political party must not try to work by taking over administrative affairs. As our Party is the organizer and guide of all victories of our people, its organizations should refrain from pushing themselves forward in performing economic work, but give policy-oriented support to the latter. The Ryongsong Machine Complex is a powerful base for manufacturing ordered equipment. The officials and workers of the complex have done much work to develop various new types of compressors. Last year when I visited this enterprise, I tasked them with producing new-type compressors on the basis of the achievements of the latest science and technology. It is a great success that they have manufactured five kinds of new-type compressors while overfulfilling the national economic plan for last year. Because it cost much to import complete sets of designs for compressors from other countries, the technicians and workers of the complex strove with a determination to undertake to design and manufacture them with their own efforts, and the Party committee of the complex actively helped them. As a result they succeeded in producing new-type compressors. The Ryongsong Machine Complex is quite capable. It is commendable that the officials of the Cabinet and the Ministry of Metal and Machine-Building Industry came down 267 to the complex to solve knotty troubles and help it produce the compressors. It is interesting that the compressors of 30m3 and 20m3 capacities the complex manufactured on the basis of its own design are called screw compressors because their rotors look like screws. The compressor, which was made on the basis of the foreign-made 3m3 piston compressor as suited to the situation of our country, is also good. It can be said that this compressor is more advanced than the foreign-made one in certain respects. It is a world trend to opt for a V-shaped or L-shaped compressor in producing a piston compressor, because the horizontal-type compressor is easily worn out by the load and its dynamic balance is not good. We should follow this trend. The complex plans to develop a sample product by supplementing the Lshaped compressor designed by the Extractive Machinery Institute of the Coal-Mining Science Branch under the Academy of Sciences. This is a good idea. The new-type compressors made by the Ryongsong Machine Complex are urgently demanded by several sectors of the national economy. The 30m3 screw compressors may be in large demand, especially in the mountainous areas where there is no source of water because they can be cooled by air. The complex plans to produce compressors of a larger capacity in future, but for the present it should manufacture the new-type compressors in large numbers. I will have help rendered to the complex for the production of the compressors. The Taean Heavy Machine Complex should produce large numbers of motors for the various types of compressors. I am told that such equipment as thread profile precision machines, rotary grinding machines, 3D measuring apparatus and precision boring machines are needed for the precision manufacturing of thread profiles. A thread profile precision machine should be imported, and copied in multiple. It is clear that the problem of compressors can be solved completely if the complex is reinforced with certain kinds of equipment. As a whole, the compressors and modern machinery equipment 268 newly produced are good. I feel pleased to see these equipment. The Ryongsong Machine Complex has become modernized. It can be said that the technical level of the complex is at a high stage. Officials of the complex did well to visit other countries last year. The Pukjung Machine Complex also achieved a sharp rise in its technical level after its officials visited foreign countries. Self-reliance should be based on new technology. In the past, self-reliance was regarded as something like making everything barehanded, but this will not do in the present conditions. Self-reliance cannot be separated from technology. Genuine self-reliance means renovating technology and relying on it. The experiences of the Ryongsong Machine Complex and the Pukjung Machine Complex attest to this truth. The workers of the Ryongsong Machine Complex have done a great job. Though some people complained about this or that as they grew faint-hearted in the face of difficulties in the period of the Arduous March and forced march, the Ryongsong workers did not yield; they rose to the challenges. One can do nothing if one becomes faint-hearted and complains about this or that problem in the face of difficulties. The Ryongsong workers are great. I am very satisfied with the fact that the shop-floor workers, technicians and office workers braved all sorts of difficulties and produced modern equipment, such as compressors. I give my thanks to all of them. The 20-metre lathe in machine workshop No. 1 is the parent of the heroic machines that produced the columns of the 6 300-ton wheel press, 6 000-ton press and 10 000-ton press. The lathe, which has performed feats of labour together with the workers of Ryongsong for decades, should itself be awarded the title of Hero. As I said before, the Ryongsong Machine Complex and the Taean Machine Complex can be called the face of heavy industry of our country. Industry should have its history and tradition. Only when the Ryongsong Machine Complex and the Taean Machine Complex boost production can all other sectors surge ahead. The workers of Ryongsong, who have a proud tradition, should make uninterrupted renovations and advance with the spirit and mettle of the days when 269 they were producing large-sized machinery despite trying difficulties. For the Ryongsong Machine Complex to produce modern machinery in large numbers, it should intensify creative cooperation between workers and technicians, and improve their technical qualifications and skills. Senior officials of the complex should organize and guide production scrupulously in order to inspire the workers and technicians to constantly aspire to new achievements. The Munhwa Cooperative Farm in Ryongjon-ri, Pukchong County, is a historical place. At the Pukchong Enlarged Meeting of the Presidium of the Party Central Committee held here President Kim Il Sung opened a new history of fruit farming in our country. It is commendable that the farm set up a monument to the President’s field guidance and is educating the farmers to add brilliance to the President’s immortal leadership exploits. The building, in which the President consulted the experienced fruit cultivators of Pukchong County, and the building in which the Pukchong Enlarged Meeting of the Presidium of the Party Central Committee was held should be well preserved. The area of orchards at the farm was 80 hectares at the time of the enlarged meeting; now it has increased to 147 hectares. If we are to boost fruit production in a decisive way we should improve seeds. We cannot increase fruit yields unless we cultivate fruit trees of superior strains. I saw to it that tens of thousands of saplings of fruit trees of new strains were sent to Kwail County in South Hwanghae Province. Other countries plant dwarf fruit trees and cultivate orchards as if they were flower gardens. The trees of new strains in the Munhwa Cooperative Farm, you say, bear the first fruit four or five years after the planting of their saplings. However, this does not conform with the world trend. We should reap the first fruit from these trees in only one or two years after planting their saplings. We should effect a seed revolution and plant fruit trees of superior strains. There is a 104-year-old apple tree at the Munhwa Cooperative Farm. President Kim Il Sung called it an ancestor of apple trees. It is 270 praiseworthy that the farm has taken meticulous care of it so as to convey the President’s exploits to the coming generations. For all that, we should refrain from trying to maintain all the apple trees for a long time in a uniform way. This method has no significance, as we should not follow the old method in planting and cultivating fruit trees, but actively introduce the experiences and techniques of the countries advanced in fruit farming. Most of the orchards at the Munhwa Cooperative Farm are sloping fields. Should we continue to create orchards on sloping fields or not? In my opinion, as the Munhwa Cooperative Farm is a historical place where the Pukchong Enlarged Meeting was held, the current orchards should be preserved as they are now and cultivated properly. But it needs a deep study if more orchards are to be created here. If mountains are cleared and orchards are created on them it will be difficult to mechanize fruit farming and relieve the farmers of hard labour; it may also cause a waste of manpower. When I visited Kwail County I told it to realign the orchards so that tractors can work while moving between fruit trees as well as between orchards. Even if roads are built between the orchards as sloping as those at this farm, it will be conducive only for mechanizing transportation. More gasoline will be needed for a tractor to run along a sloping road than to run along an even road because the tractors must run in first gear in the former case. You say that the whole farm is mobilized to harvest apples in autumn. It is hard, I think, to do fruit farming in that way in our country with a limited manpower. Another point is that farmers have to descend the slopes with heavy loads of apples on their backs. To do fruit farming by creating orchards on mountain slopes is neither wise nor cost-effective. In my opinion, it would be better for this farm to create orchards on the wide flatland, where dwelling houses are now standing, for effective fruit farming. Then, you can mechanize fruit farming and boost production. Dwelling houses can be moved to the foot of the mountain. The orchards and maize fields at many farms are terraced fields like those at the Munhwa Cooperative Farm. This is not good. 271 Farming should not be done in disregard of geographical feature and cost-effectiveness. One country is said to be cultivating groundnuts mainly, because most of its crop lands are sandy. Our people, regardless of the geographical conditions and cost-effectiveness, tend to cultivate this crop if they are told this is a good crop or that crop if they are told that is good. They should refrain from doing farm work in that way. It would be advisable for the Munhwa Cooperative Farm to study in depth whether it would be better to cultivate apple trees more or mulberry trees on the terraced fields. Mulberry farming is easier than fruit farming. To pick mulberry leaves and carry them in knapsacks is far easier than to pick apples and carry them on the back. All types of work should be done on the principle of gaining profit. The Munhwa Cooperative Farm should calculate whether it would be more profitable to plant mulberry trees on the terraced fields and raise silkworms or to create more fruit fields there for fruit farming. Officials of this farm should visit Kwail County, meet the senior officials there and look around the orchards. On their return they should plan the future of their farm in detail and inform me of it. South Hamgyong Province plans to convert the hillocks in their province, which have been destroyed by fire, into orchards. This needs further study on the basis of cost-effectiveness. Fruit farming, too, should be put on a scientific, specialized and mechanized footing as demanded by the present era of science and technology. Cultivating orchards in a way of carrying loads on the back in this era is nothing but repetition of the outdated method of cultivation. There is no law forbidding other farms across the country adopting the method of fruit cultivation applied by the Munhwa Cooperative Farm simply because the latter is a place associated with the President’s revolutionary activities. What the Party demands is that the spirit of the Pukchong meeting should be emulated, not the method of fruit cultivation of the Munhwa Cooperative Farm. It is the Party’s will to have many fruit trees planted and cultivated properly in the rural communities in accordance with the spirit of the 272 Pukchong meeting so as to provide our people with sufficient amounts of fruit. We should attach importance to science and technology, and follow the world trend in fruit farming as well. We should free farmers from hard labour by actively introducing advanced science and technology and mechanizing all the processes of fruit production. We should create new methods of fruit cultivation in line with the demands of the era, as we have entered a new century. To put fruit farming on a specialized footing is also important. The President kindled the torch of developing fruit farming at the Munhwa Cooperative Farm in Ryongjon-ri, Pukchong County, and he opened a new history of putting fruit farming on a specialized footing in Kwail County in South Hwanghae Province. Fruit farming should be put on a specialized footing. The crop lands at the Munhwa Cooperative Farm are well laid out. I am satisfied with the realigned paddy and non-paddy fields, which will be favourable for doing farm work by machines, making labour easier and increasing crop yields. It is good that the farm gathered more than five tons of crops per hectare last year, and cultivated two crops every year with potatoes as the first crop. The farm should realign more crop fields and raise better crops in the future. The Chonghung Cooperative Farm in Pukchong County is particularly praiseworthy in that it is doing farming by its own efforts without any labour assistance from other units. It is good that the water flowing into the paddies in front of us is from the Pukchong River and the paddies do not dry up. The farm should raise good crops as it did last year. Especially, it should conduct stone-leek farming well, as instructed by the President. Pukchong County has laid out and managed the Songjon Revolutionary Battle Site well. I do not know why this battle site situated in Chonghung-ri is called the Songjon Revolutionary Battle Site. You say that this place has been called Songjon from olden times, because it is covered with pine trees. I see. This is a house which my mother Kim Jong Suk visited on two occasions, and all the materials related to those visits have been 273 verified. The President wrote in his memoirs that he had once read Kumranjigyejon. The Kumran Association was formed by the Pukchong people, who had a high anti-Japanese spirit, and Kumranjigyejon was written by the householder of this house, who was the head of the local chapter of the Association for the Restoration of the Fatherland and influential among the association members. The songs, Let Us Follow General Kim and Hymn to a Woman Fighter, singing the praises of Commander Kim Il Sung and my mother Kim Jong Suk, were composed and disseminated by the members of the ARF in this place; I know those songs well. The marker of my mother’s revolutionary activities is impressive. The local people must have taken much trouble to erect it in the trying days. Our people are laudable, indeed. The house and the slogan-bearing trees should be preserved properly, and education based on this battle site should be conducted effectively. The 55 houses built in Chonghung-ri on the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the founding of the Workers’ Party of Korea look fine. The roof tiles made of clay look good. The problem of roof tiles can be solved if they are made of clay, which is abundant locally. The village looks clean and tidy. It should be maintained well. The chairman of the management board and the secretary of the Party committee of the Chonghung Cooperative Farm should work more effectively. Pukchong County has built fine houses in Chonghung-ri and Tangu-ri, and is maintaining the local roads properly. It is good that the county Party committee had 60 houses built in three months from late last year with the efforts of the county itself, regarding the project as its own responsibility. The houses built in Tangu-ri are as neat as those in Chonghung-ri. The Pukchong County Party Committee did a lot of work. I highly appreciate this. The Party Committee of South Hamgyong Province has launched a campaign to build houses in cities and counties in recent years, and built many houses every year. The committee was right to move the houses standing in the middle of paddies and non-paddies to the feet 274 of mountains. South Hamgyong Province is building houses as well as South Hwanghae Province does. The monument inscribed with the President’s field guidance instructions and the monument to his revolutionary activities were erected well in the Hamhung Branch of the Academy of Sciences. The branch academy planted 100 000 trees of 50 species in its compound following my visit to it in March 1999 with the assistance of the province-level organs and the nearby cities and counties and under the guidance of the provincial Party committee. As many trees have been planted and the compound laid out well, how beautiful it is! It will be conducive to the emotional life of the scientists and their research work. The head of the branch has expressed thanks to me, saying that the branch, which had been on the verge of crumbling in the days of the Arduous March, regained momentum after my field guidance to it. The credit for this should be given to the Party, not to me. The situation of the country was too difficult for the Party to help the branch, and so the task fell to the Party. In recent years the scientists of the branch have achieved many successes in their research as they have exerted laborious and painstaking efforts in loyal support of the Party’s leadership. These achievements will make great contributions to the development of the country’s science and technology and to the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country. On my current visit I have found that the branch is comfortably solvent. Its purchase of state-of-the-art scientific research equipment was well done. Its scientists are competent and know how to make effective use of money. As the branch has now world-class laboratory equipment, it will be by no means inferior to the world standards if a few sets of equipment are added. I will make funds available to it for purchasing the necessary sets of equipment. I am glad to meet doctor couples. You should work harder as doctors in the era of the Workers’ Party and its members so as to add lustre to the honour of being scientist families. You should not only 275 improve your qualifications continuously but train many reserve scientists. Scientists should become ardent patriots and revolutionaries before being intellectuals. They should devote themselves to the benefit of their country and fellows with burning patriotic ardour, and establish a revolutionary climate of research work so as to solve in a timely fashion the scientific and technological problems arising in various sectors of the national economy. If scientists are to serve the Party, the revolution, the country and the people by means of science and technology, they should decisively improve their qualifications. They cannot scale the high peak of cutting-edge science and technology if their qualifications are low. Scientists should establish a revolutionary habit of studying, and study hard to be well-versed in their fields of specialization, the current trends of scientific and technological development and a wide range of knowledge. Party and administrative officials of the scientific and research institutions should conduct their work with scientists in a proper manner. Scientists are an asset of the country and pride of the nation. They will display great strength in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country if they are motivated ideologically. Ideology is the main thing in scientific research and a key to the solution of all problems. Success in their scientific research depends on for whom they work, how they work and for what. No matter how excellent the equipment they have for their scientific research, they cannot prove their merits unless they are well prepared ideologically. Party organizations should strengthen edification of scientists so as to make sure that the latter buckle down to scientific research with intense loyalty to the Party, the revolution, the country and the people, and continuously push forward the frontiers of science and technology. They should actively introduce other countries’ latest achievements in science and technology. Self-reliance, for scientists, should be aimed at introducing other countries’ latest achievements and making them their own as well as at pushing forward the frontiers of science and 276 technology with their own efforts and wisdom. Scientific and technical exchanges with other countries should therefore be conducted briskly. Scientists should not confine themselves to achieving experimental successes but introduce them actively into the various sectors of the national economy. When they are helping factories and enterprises on-site, they should not be diffident, but come forward with ambitious plans for renovating them in a modern fashion and putting them on a scientific footing. They should take an active part in the February 17 scientists-andtechnicians shock brigades. Only then will they be able to become aware of the actual situation and potentials of the country, and combine science and technology properly. As there are many pieces of precious research equipment in the Hamhung Branch, special concern should be directed to supplying electricity to it. Electricity of proper voltage and frequency should be supplied for the normal operation of the state-of-the-art equipment. The branch should repair and reinforce the electrical appliances and network, including electric wires, so that they will not break down. A strict system and order should be observed in scientific research work, and modern scientific research equipment managed properly and made effective use of. The rooms of the buildings in the Hamhung Branch are no different from those of other organs and schools. It is a trend to make rooms wide and make effective use of them by partitioning them inside. Then, the partitioned spaces can be made wider or narrower as needed, and this is convenient for exchanging information. In future the buildings of the branch should be transferred to another institution and new buildings constructed in a modern way. I have done well to visit the Hamhung Branch of the State Academy of Sciences today. Here I have heard of good research results. Scientists should produce many ingenious hypotheses and ideas. Only then can the Party formulate correct policies and the country 277 achieve prosperity. I hope the Hamhung Branch will continue to work well as expected by the Party. It is good that Jongphyong County has finished the construction of the Kumjingang Power Station in the main, and is conducting no-load test operations of the three hydro-generators of 2 000-kilowatt capacity each produced by the province itself. The power station should be commissioned only when no problem occurs during load test operations after substations have been built and transmission lines laid. Even if you are to do only one thing, you should do it perfectly and immaculately. You say that the dam project on the Kumjin River could only be completed because the Party sent trucks and tractors. I think it was only because officials and the youth shock brigade members in Jongphyong County worked hard. It is praiseworthy that the Kwangmyongsong Salt Works has worked well and supplied its products to the people in the province. You say that the reed fields of 300 hectares near the salt works were reclaimed as paddy fields and rice was test-cultivated there last year, but the per-hectare yield was low owing to damage by reed roots and salinity. You might experience difficulties for two or three years because reeds have a strong capability to survive, so it is good that the people in Kumya County turned out as one to root up the reeds and readjust the irrigation network, thus preventing salinity damage. The Hamhung Youth Goat Farm bought milk-processing facilities with the money I had given it in acknowledgement of its services, and attained the capacity to process ten tons of milk a day. This farm is a world-class one. The Hamhung Youth Goat Farm, Hamju Goat Farm and Hungnam Goat Farm are supplying dairy products to the people of Hamhung and Hungnam every day. The local people are thus sharing the benefits of the goat farms. It would be good to use the remainder of the money I sent for building the Hamhung Youth Goat Farm for buying vehicles and containers for transporting milk products by the Hungnam and Hamju goat farms. South Hamgyong Province, true to the intention of the Party, has built many monumental edifices, such as the Kwangmyongsong Salt 278 Works, power stations in tiers on the Songchon River, Kumjingang Power Station and Hamhung Youth Goat Farm by launching natureremoulding projects in a big way; they should be built up perfectly and managed properly so that they can contribute to developing the local economy and improving the local people’s living standards. Only then can the province become a genuine example in natureremaking, and add brilliance to the leadership exploits of the Party. During my current visit to South Hamgyong Province I have found that it has achieved many successes. I am greatly satisfied. Jagang Province created the Kanggye spirit, and South Hamgyong Province has boasted many new achievements in recent years. South Hamgyong Province should take thorough measures for carrying out the tasks I have given it during my current field guidance at several sectors of the province in order to make a new leap forward in the economic work in the province in line with the requirements of the new century.",south hamgyong province factory enterprise mine tanchon area ryongsong machine complex february vinalon complex

14.09.2002,Kim Jong Il,"I feel grateful that you have presented a written questionnaire to me on the eve of Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro’s visit to Korea. Several of the questions you raised will be discussed at the meeting between Prime Minister Koizumi and me, so I would like to answer only the questions related with the relationship between Korea and Japan. The world attention is now focused on Korea, and interest in our forthcoming meeting is running high. Korea and Japan are geographically close countries, and they had maintained relations from olden times exchanging visits with each other. But in the past century discord and confrontation has brought the relations between the two countries to an extremely abnormal state. The abnormal relations continuing between them even after half a century after the Second World War are, in every respect, harmful to either of them. Normalizing relations between the two countries and developing good-neighbourly relations accords with the aspirations and interests of the peoples of the two countries, and it is an urgent demand of the times. Korea and Japan are Asian nations. They should live in friendship as nearest neighbours, not as near and distant neighbours, and promote coexistence and coprosperity. This is our will and consistent standpoint. 301 The politicians of Korea and Japan are now entrusted with the historic mission to normalize the abnormal relations between the two countries. If responsible statesmen make decisions from a large point of view and get down to the task in order to realize the people’s desires and interests and fulfil their noble historic mission, they will be able to find solutions to any problems existing between the two countries. Prime Minister Koizumi will soon visit Pyongyang, and this will be a turning point in normalizing Korea-Japan relations. I welcome his visit to my country and believe that our meeting will bring forth good fruit. We must open up a new chapter in the historical relationship between Korea and Japan by our common will and joint effort to improve their relations in every possible way. The basic problem that must be solved to normalize Korea-Japan relations is to clean up the past unpleasant events that have taken place between the two countries. If nothing is done to the history of rancour that has accumulated for a whole century, neither the normalization of state relations nor good-neighbourly, friendly relations can be realized. Japan’s settlement of its past necessitates a sincere apology and due compensation that takes into full consideration the whole range of damages and sufferings it inflicted upon the Korean people. The lack of solution to these core issues has so far curbed improvement of the bilateral relations and presented a variety of complicated problems. The two countries are now tied up hand and foot, trapped as they are in mudslinging over minor issues, but these will be settled smoothly when bilateral relations improve and mutual confidence is built. An end to abnormal relations will also dissipate the security concerns of the Japanese people. Apparently the Japanese people are highly nervous about our defence build-up, but our defence policy is, to all intents and purposes, geared to self-defence. Our armed forces will mercilessly deal with those who provoke us, but we will never resort to force of arms against those who do not. If Japan gives up 302 hostility for friendship towards us, it has nothing to fear about our defence upbuilding. Finally, as for your question about my intention to visit Japan, I think there would be no reason why I should not visit Japan so long as bilateral relations develop favourably on a normal track.

25.11.2002,Kim Jong Il,"Today marks the 64th anniversary of the conference of the military and political cadres of the Korean People’s Revolutionary Army held in Nanpaizi, at which Commander Kim Il Sung made the historic speech Let Us Break the Present Deadlock and Lead a Continuous Advance of the Revolution. On the anniversary of this conference, part 17 of the documentary film For the Liberation of the Country dealing with his memoirs was broadcast on the Central TV channel. When I watched the documentary together with you, I was struck with a new feeling and deep impression. Whenever the situation is complicated and difficult, I gain fresh energy and courage recalling the history of President Kim Il Sung’s revolutionary activities. Seeing the documentary film today, I felt keenly once again his unshakeable faith in the victory of the revolution, unflinching courage and indomitable revolutionary spirit, and hardened my determination to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered by him, whatever hardships and trials stand in my way. No one in the world is a match for him in terms of faith, will and courage. He was not only an outstanding theoretician, a great 304 statesman and an iron-willed commander but also strongest in faith, will and courage. As shown by the documentary, the Arduous March from Nanpaizi to Beidadingzi was the most trying and severest trial. The guerrillas had to advance inch by inch, defeating hordes of Japanese soldiers, who viciously harassed them day and night. Worse still, the conditions of the march went from bad to worse due to bitter cold and shortage of food. The march was a do-or-die struggle decisive of the destiny of our sacred revolution for liberating the country. In such a grim situation Commander Kim Il Sung brought the arduous march to a victorious end by braving difficulties with the bold attitude that there would always be a way out even though the sky should fall, the firm belief in victory and the staunch determination to destroy the enemy and win back the country even at the cost of his life. It was by dint of such faith, courage and will that he led the antiJapanese revolutionary struggle and the building of a new Korea, the Fatherland Liberation War and socialist construction to a brilliant victory, tiding over all sorts of hardships and trials. In this sense, the history of his revolutionary struggle can be called a history of faith, will and courage. Clearly, faith in the revolution, pluck and indomitable revolutionary spirit are a temperament congenial to the members of my Mangyongdae family. The documentary portrays the fact that the Japanese imperialists subjected Ri Po Ik, then on the wrong side of 60, to all kinds of cruelties, dragging her around Mt Paektu and Manchuria in order to induce her grandson Commander Kim Il Sung to “surrender.” Whenever she was treated cruelly by the enemy, she would say in fury that if they hurt her General Kim would not spare them, striking them with horror. She was a woman of extraordinary courage. President Kim Il Sung once said that his grandmother Ri Po Ik had not been a career revolutionary, merely an old countrywoman who had never been to school, never even learned to read and write, but her love for the country, the nation and the people was firm, believing that one must dedicate even one’s life without the slightest 305 hesitation for the good of the country and the people. With this belief she took pride in having her sons and grandsons on the road of restoring the country, and actively supported them. Revolution is carried on by dint of faith and will, not mere knowledge or words. This is well testified to by the example of Ri Jong Rak dealt with in the documentary. As President Kim Il Sung wrote, Ri Jong Rak had been a revolutionary with his own political views in the days of the Down-with-Imperialism Union; he was well informed about military affairs and sensitive to new ideological trends. He was once recommended to a responsible post of the Korean Revolutionary Army. But as he lacked faith and principle, he surrendered to the enemy, shrinking from difficulties, when the revolution was experiencing trying ordeals. Historical experience shows that when the situation is favourable and the revolution wins one victory after another, there appear no waverers or degenerates, but that when the situation is unfavourable and hardships and trials stand in the way of the revolution, waverers, degenerates and even turncoats appear. In the days of the Arduous March and forced march, when the isolate-and-stifle attempts made by imperialist reactionaries were at their extreme, defeatists, waverers, turncoats and traitors appeared even among our revolutionary ranks. An advanced idea is useful only when it is made an article of one’s faith; it is of no use if it is acquired as part of mere knowledge. An idea which has not been made an article of one’s faith is liable to degenerate, and if one degenerates ideologically, one may be reduced to a renegade like Ri Jong Rak. Revolution is an undertaking conducted by dint of faith, will and courage. If one is not firm in faith and will, and lacks courage, one cannot carry out the revolution braving all manner of storms. This is a solid truth that was etched in my mind when I was going through ordeals in tears of blood, shouldering the destiny of the country and the nation after the death of President Kim Il Sung. I am now leading the revolution and construction with faith in sure victory and the courage that nobody can be a match for a man who is 306 ready to meet death. To counter the enemy’s dagger with a sword and the enemy’s rifle with a cannon–such is our Party’s faith, will and courage. Thanks to this faith, will and courage, we have been able to emerge victorious in the fierce confrontation with the United States and firmly defend socialism. Confrontation with the enemy can be called a showdown between faith, will and courage. There is nothing to fear and nothing that cannot be overcome if one has strong conviction, will and courage. When the people all over the country possess the faith and courage that was cherished by President Kim Il Sung and have been inherited by our Party, we can surely build a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country on this land and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche, foiling any challenges of the enemy. We must ensure that Party members, soldiers, working people and youth study further the history of President Kim Il Sung’s revolutionary activities. The history of his revolutionary activities is the root and eternal cornerstone of our Party and our revolution. This history continues thanks to our Party, enjoying eternal vitality. The sure guarantee of the victory of our revolution is in thoroughly defending the history of President Kim Il Sung’s revolutionary activities and adding lustre to it. Stepping up the study of the history of President Kim Il Sung’s revolutionary activities presents itself as a very important task today, when the change of generations of the revolution is taking place and the younger generation is appearing as masters of the country. In our country today the younger generation constitutes the main force of the revolution and construction. Unless they diligently study the history of President’s revolutionary activities, they may not know how their socialist system was established and not know how to keep the faith and determination to defend their socialist motherland at the cost of their lives. The deeper the revolution develops with the change of generations, the more intense the study of the President’s revolutionary activities should be. The situation of our revolution today is as complicated and acute 307 as ever. The US and Japanese imperialists and other reactionaries are making ever-more pernicious attempts to isolate and stifle our country. Recently, the United States has unilaterally abrogated the DPRK-USA Agreed Framework and is kicking up a fuss about our nuclear issue, driving the situation of our country to the brink of war, and the right-wing reactionaries of Japan are going to the length of declaring that they are willing to fight a war with our country. We are not afraid of the moves of the US and Japanese imperialists, but we have to be prepared to face trials even severer than those of the days of the Arduous March and forced march. Party organizations and other political organs should intensify the study of the history of President Kim Il Sung’s revolutionary activities among all the Party members, service personnel, working people and youth so as to encourage them to have a firm faith and courage, and fight a do-ordie struggle against the enemy and emerge the ultimate victors however grave the hardships and trials that stand in our way. We should ensure that Party members, soldiers, working people and youth make a regular and effective study of the Pictorial Records of the History of the Revolutionary Activities of Comrade Kim Il Sung. It is good educational material which visually explains the glorious history of the President’s revolutionary activities. I long and deeply thought about how to model the whole society on the President’s revolutionary ideology and set it as my lifelong task since I started working at the Party Central Committee. Frankly speaking, in the early days when I started working at the Party Central Committee the educational work to equip Party members and other working people with the President’s revolutionary ideology was being conducted in a quite passive way. The anti-Party, counter-revolutionary elements who had appeared in our Party in the mid-1960s made cunning attempts to distort and sling mud at the revolutionary traditions created by President Kim Il Sung while disseminating revisionist and feudal Confucian ideas. After they were eliminated by organizational measures at the 15th Plenary Meeting of the Fourth Party Central Committee, I took radical steps to get rid of their backward 308 ideological leftovers and establish a monolithic ideological system throughout the Party. I ensured that an ideological struggle to wipe out the ideological dregs diffused by the anti-Party, counterrevolutionary elements was waged dynamically and at the same time education in the monolithic ideology was conducted proactively at a higher level among Party members and other working people. One of the steps taken at that time was to change the Rooms for the Study of the History of the Workers’ Party of Korea into the Rooms for the Study of the History of the Revolutionary Activities of Comrade Kim Il Sung, and have a new version of pictorial records that reflect in breadth the history of the President’s revolutionary activities compiled and installed in the rooms. Now such rooms can be found everywhere in our country, and all the education rooms of companies of the People’s Army are furnished with the pictorial records. We should improve and strengthen the running of these rooms in line with the requirements of the developing revolution, so that Party members, soldiers, working people and youth can learn about the history of the President’s revolutionary activities in a systematic and all-round way. We should arrange effective study of President Kim Il Sung’s memoirs, the review of the history of his revolutionary activities. When one studies the pictorial records and the memoirs, one can acquire a wider and deeper knowledge of the history of the President’s revolutionary activities. The memoirs give a touching and historical description of his revolutionary activities and the actual persons and incidents involved, and describe the principles of the revolution and the human struggle and life. They not only provide an easy understanding of the history of his revolutionary activities, they also leave a lasting impression. This shows that the memoirs have a great power of influence and persuasion. A few years ago when I dropped in at the workers’ hostel of an enterprise in Jagang Province, I asked the officials there which books were most popular among young people these days. They replied that young people liked to read the President’s memoirs, adding that the 309 stock of the books was too small to be read by many people. So they asked for more copies of the memoirs. It is a laudable thing that young people like to read the President’s memoirs. We should publish the memoirs in large numbers so that a broad spectrum of people, including soldiers and young people, can read them. Along with this, it is necessary to strengthen study of the documentaries produced on the basis of the memoirs. The documentaries are of great educational importance because their scenes are excerpted from the President’s memoirs. We should see to it that the documentaries are shown at cinemas and broadcast regularly on TV. We should arrange visits widely to the revolutionary battle sites and other revolutionary historic sites. These sites are bases for visual education in the history of the President’s revolutionary activities. Party organizations and other political organs at all levels should better lay out the sites and arrange visits to them in a planned and significant way so that Party members, soldiers, working people and youth can more deeply understand the history of his revolutionary activities. The history of President Kim Il Sung’s revolutionary activities is now being carried forward brilliantly in the form of the history of our Party’s Songun revolution. Our Songun politics is an ever-victorious mode of politics that defeats any formidable enemy and breaks through any hardships and trials by dint of iron faith and will and matchless courage. Party organizations and other political organs should ensure that Party members, soldiers, working people and youth intensely study the Party’s Songun idea and the history of its Songun-based revolution so that they can have a firm belief in the might of Songun politics and cherish a firm conviction that they will surely emerge victorious so long as Songun politics is administered, however complicated the situation may be and whatever hardships and trials may stand in their way. Revolutionary faith, will and courage should be applied in the practical activities to support the Party’s Songun idea and leadership, not mere words. The more viciously the imperialist reactionaries 310 attempt to isolate and stifle our country, the more determinedly all officials and Party members, soldiers and working people should confront and frustrate them with courage and faith in sure victory, and firmly defend the sovereignty of the country and the nation and socialism. We should plan all undertakings in an ambitious way and carry them out with indomitable willpower and an aggressive spirit, thereby bringing about signal changes and progress in the revolution and construction. Our struggle is not yet over, and a long and arduous way stretches ahead of us. We need to surmount hardships of every description and attain one victory after another by dint of conviction in sure victory, will and courage. All officials, Party members, soldiers and other working people should work more doggedly under the Songun leadership of the Party to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche with firm conviction in the victory of the revolution, willpower and a steadfast revolutionary spirit.",today mark anniversary conference military political cadre revolutionary army hold nanpaizi commander sung historic

03.01.2003,Kim Jong Il,"I am glad to meet you, journalists and writers, on the occasion of the New Year’s Day by the lunar calendar. Thank you for your greetings. Happy New Year! You say you have spent your time and greeted holidays with yearning for me; I have never forgotten you who have supported the Party’s Songun politics by means of writing. I know journalists and writers want to see me, reciting poems and singing songs filled with longing for me, but I have failed to see them often, because I am so pressed for time. For me, time is gold. You are missing me, and vice versa–this is an expression of our Party’s love for the pen. I was so eager to see you that I have called you today. I am happy to hear that your yearning for me is a source of your creative zeal, and that you feel strength and passion welling up after seeing me. The writers of the Central Committee of the Writers Union of Korea are said to be celebrating the New Year’s Day by the lunar calendar in tears of gratitude for the colour TV sets which the Party gave them as a gift. I have heard their opinion. They have nobody to rely on but the Party. I am pleased to know that they are happy with the TV sets. It is commendable that the writers have expressed their 349 determination to follow to the end the road of the Songun revolution under the guidance of the Party, cherishing revolutionary pens. I have heard with pleasure that our people are delighted to celebrate the New Year’s Day by the lunar calendar in a grand style in spite of the difficult situation, saying that it is another manifestation of the Party’s benevolence. From now on I am going to have the New Year’s Day by the lunar calendar, which had been celebrated traditionally, celebrated more splendidly. Love for one’s nation is expressed in valuing, preserving and developing the fine traditions created by the nation itself. To celebrate the New Year’s Day by the lunar calendar is of great significance in educating the people in the Korean-nation-first spirit. A writer present here saw people spending the holiday merrily in all parts of Pyongyang as he looked round the city as a war correspondent of the Supreme Headquarters and a companion, supporter and adviser of the Party. He says that people were eating kogijaengban noodles (meat-garnished cold noodles in tray–Tr.) and Pyongyang cold noodles with relish at the Okryu Restaurant, saying that the quality of the noodles had been raised thanks to the Party’s loving care, and some others were having catfish soup and other dishes at the Pyongyang Catfish Soup Restaurant and Chongnyu Restaurant with delight. We find it rewarding to carry out a revolution through thick and thin if people enjoy pleasure and happiness. Whenever I am told that people feel delighted at something, I refresh my determination to work harder. You say you read the cheers for General Kim Jong Il and the victory of the Songun revolution in the images of the people celebrating the holiday with delight. Thank you. I am very pleased that our people celebrate the New Year’s Day by the lunar calendar in the structures President Kim Il Sung built for them. Our people have no other place where they can lead a genuine life and enjoy happiness but their motherland, for it is the very embrace of the President and the Party. Today I heard very encouraging remarks from you. That is why I love journalists and writers, and call them spokespersons of our Party. 350 They speak for my politics. I love the pen, and attach importance to it. You support the Party’s Songun politics by producing masterpieces. The role of the pen is very important in supporting Songun politics. Journalists and writers play significant roles for the victory of the Songun revolution. Our Party firmly trusts and sincerely loves the journalists and writers who produce good works. You produced many good works, including poems, in support of the Party’s Songun politics during the Arduous March and forced march. They were a great inspiration to our people who were advancing unyieldingly under the banner of socialism in the face of the imperialists’ vicious attempts and blockade to isolate and stifle our Republic. I felt exhausted on many occasions, but each time I would gain fresh strength from the support for and trust in me of the revolutionary comrades of Songun like you and others. In particular, your works inspired me greatly. While reading works like the article of political editorial The Songs of the Revolutionary Army Fire Our Hearts, I deliberate on several matters and work out new plans. I am most happy when I read inspiring articles. That is why I read your works without exception. If I am pressed for time, I manage to find time anyway afterwards to read them. The epic Comrade Kim Il Sung Is Our Eternal Leader produced when our people were undergoing the gravest trying ordeals after the death of President Kim Il Sung, is a ten-out-of-ten, world-class masterpiece. The work greatly inspired Party members and other working people. The other epics produced on the occasion of the second, third and fifth anniversaries of the President’s death also gave great inspiration and food for thought to our people. Good are the words of the songs The Tuman River Full of Memories and Sunny Tuman River. The words of the recently produced songs related to the Tuman River are all good, so I had them carried in Rodong Sinmun in bold letters. The song We Call First is good both in its words and music. I have mastered the words of the song. I like the song every time I listen to. It is really an excellent song. A song can be called a famous 351 song when it is easy to sing, pleasant to the ears and when it is possible to dance to its tune. The song We Call First describes the Party’s ideological intention in a lifelike, profound manner. It is one of the works representative of the Songun era which mirrors our Party’s idea of supporting the army. I like such songs based on real life and loved by the soldiers and other people, and love the writers who produce such excellent works. The writers should support their leader with all sincerity and sing the praises of their motherland and fellows. I attach importance to songs, because they reflect our Party’s politics and serve as an instrument for motivating the people to the struggle. The poem 2002, We Call You a Year of Guerrilla Style, which was produced seeing out last year, also inspired me. Its title is novel, and its poetic description of the year 2002 through a spot in the Mt Paektu area is also good. Set in Mt Paektu, the poem begins with the bonfire spot where I baked potatoes, portraying last year as a year when the revolution was led in guerrilla style. The words “a year of guerrilla style” is meaningful. As the poem goes, last year can be called a year of guerrilla style when I led the Songun revolution in guerrilla style. The poem evokes memories of last year. It is more moving because the poet recalled the year’s events and historic sites after seeing the bonfire spot in the Mt Paektu area in person. Unlike works in other genres, a poem can give a deeper impression when its author has experienced a great feeling. The poet has recited a part of the poem. I like bonfires, just as the poem says. This is probably because I was born on Mt Paektu and spent my childhood in the forest and raging snowstorms. Revolutionaries should not be disdainful of bonfires, because the road ahead of the revolution is still long and thorny. Bonfires bear a deep meaning. When I sit by a bonfire, I am automatically reminded of the bonfires of the anti-Japanese guerrillas. Bonfires are well suited to the Songun era. It was right indeed for us to have held up the banner of Songun. Songun politics is a new mode of politics advanced by our Party. As 352 you have written in your works, we are fully justified in pursuing Songun politics. Songun politics is our lifeline. But for Songun politics, we would have failed to defend socialism and the people’s happiness, and you could not have slept peacefully. We have been able to defend the country thanks to Songun politics and Mt Osong, its symbol. As is written in the article Fortress of Prosperity carried in Rodong Sinmun, I cannot help shedding tears, being reminded of the trying years of the Arduous March and forced march just at the mention of the name of the mountain, a painful period of ordeal. I still feel my heart rending whenever I remember the period of the Arduous March and forced march. I will never forget the years when we were experiencing heartbreaking events after President Kim Il Sung’s sudden death. Our Songun politics is nothing but politics for the good of the people. Love for the people constitutes the core of my politics. When our country was experiencing grave hardships, I administered Songun politics out of infinite love for the people, and inspected the frontline posts of the Korean People’s Army which are situated within a stone’s throw of the enemy’s posts. You say that whenever you visit different units to gain experience in reality, you feel that the soldiers and other people are longing for me. I miss them, too. I miss the soldiers and other people, and they miss me–this is a manifestation of our single-hearted unity and a true image of our society. My politics is no different from President Kim Il Sung’s. My politics is his politics. Foolishly enough, the US imperialists are trying desperately to isolate the leadership of our revolution from the people. The more frantic efforts the enemy make, the mightier and solider our harmonious whole and single-hearted unity become. As our people support the Party’s Songun politics faithfully, all things go well in our country. Journalists and writers say that ours has become a powerful Paektusan nation; their viewing angle is surely different from that of the ordinary people. Our country has now become a country that cannot be ignored by others. Because our 353 country is the motherland of Songun politics, many countries, big or small, try to establish friendly relations with us. In its feudal days our country had to curry favour with big countries, reading their faces, but today those countries try to approach our country. Many countries actively support our cause, and the big countries, which were once hostile to our country, give in to us. Forever gone are the days when big countries belittled our country. The might and vitality of Songun politics are being proved more clearly with each passing day, and reality shows how correct we were for having pursued Songun politics and built up the defence industry, tightening our belts. As for my Songun politics, nobody would know its width and depth. That is why the enemy is more afraid of it. Now the US imperialists are resorting to high-handedness, but this is an expression of desperation. Their threats and blackmail cannot work with us. However wildly they run amuck, I am not daunted in the least. Ours is a nation with a strong sense of self-respect, and we will not tolerate anybody who provokes us. The US imperialists may do this or that, but they cannot go to the length of violating even a blade of grass or a single tree in our country. We remain safe because the People’s Army defends socialism as the main force of the revolution. Songun politics is the guarantee of all victories. As long as we administer Songun politics, we will surely emerge victorious. This is a truth and a law. As is written in The General with an Iron Will, an article carried in Rodong Sinmun, conviction in victory is my faith. Ours is a cause of justice, which is certain to win. This year is a year of guerrilla style, a year of bold offensive, like last year. We should defend the red flag of the revolution and the socialism of our own style by leading the Songun revolution in guerrilla style and launching an ambitious offensive. As the epic Blazing the Trail of History emphasizes, if the enemy draws a dagger, we will wield a sword, and if he aims a rifle, we will aim a cannon. I will fight against the US imperialists with the utmost conviction, courage and will. By temperament, a revolutionary must win if he ever has to fight. In his lifetime President Kim Il Sung said on 354 several occasions that I am strong in faith. You say it was difficult for you to keep abreast of the rapidly changing global situation last year; it makes no difference to me. When one has a firm faith, one has nothing to be afraid of and nothing is impossible to do, however the global situation may change. I am optimistic about the future of our revolution, and awake or asleep I think only about the Korean revolution and about how to make our people better-off. In future, too, everything will go smoothly. As long as we continue to follow Songun politics, our people will develop their country into a great, prosperous and powerful one where they are envious of nothing, enjoying the dignity and honour of being members of an independent nation, and achieve the final victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered on Mt Paektu. Men of letters in the Songun era have assumed heavy duties. Their mission is to produce fine works that would serve as an ideological and mental stimulus for our people in order to build a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country under the banner of Songun and bring the revolutionary cause of Juche to completion. They should prove themselves faithful to the Party’s cause by producing good works which are of tremendous significance in educating the people. Good written works serve as mental food which inspires the people to the implementation of the Party’s cause and hardens their ideological readiness to share their destiny with the Party and their conviction and determination to defend Korean-style socialism. Men of letters should become fighters for the Songun revolution who support the Party with revolutionary pens. Journalists and writers should firmly rally the people around the Party by producing good works dealing with the Party. They should write every piece of work so that it pulsates with the Party’s ideas, clearly mirrors its intention and carries philosophical depth. They should write about what the Supreme Commander is thinking about and how he is leading the revolution, and inform people of them. They should produce articles and other works dealing with our Party’s conviction, will and courage in great numbers so as to inspire 355 our soldiers and other people with confidence in victory and unrivalled courage. They should give wide publicity to the might and vitality of the Party’s Songun politics by means of articles and other works, so as to motivate the people to the revolutionary struggle. They should frustrate the anti-socialist moves of the US imperialists through intensive writing campaigns. They should inform the people of how we are defending and adding brilliance to socialism in the present tense and acute situation so that the latter can cherish national pride and self-respect. The Party organ plays an incomparably great role in providing the people with ideological and mental sustenance. Its journalists play a very important role. The Party organ should carry a weight appropriate to it. Weightiness, dignity and authority are essential to the Party organ. If the Party organ is to retain its traits, its articles and its editing should be weighty. Party organ should preserve its tradition in future, too, and carry weight in its editing. Journalists and writers should frequently go to real life to gain practical experience for producing excellent works. It is only when they acquire rich knowledge through practical experience that they can write excellent works. Particularly, poets should prepare themselves for feeling the impact of reality; only then can they write good poems congenial to the people’s sentiments. You say you made visits to Mt Osong, Height 1211, Height 351, Kkachi Peak and other frontline posts following the course I had taken. They are meaningful places. You say you also visited Samjiyon and Taehongdan counties along the route of my on-site guidance, and met those people whom I had met, calling at the houses of discharged soldiers. The discharged soldiers do their bit in Taehongdan County. Wherever I go, I am reminded of them. You say you had heard that the Mt Paektu area was being laid out in a fresh way, but never imagined that it could be laid out so splendidly. It may well be so. The Samjiyon County Town has undergone a great change. One more year of construction there will make it even more splendid. Journalists are said to be commenting that the wonderful realities of prosperity are unfolding 356 from the foot of Mt Paektu, not from Kaesong or Sinuiju, as they have witnessed the changes that took place in Samjiyon and Taehongdan counties. I am determined to develop the Mt Paektu area into an ideal socialist land, where people enjoy the highest standard of living. At the end of last year the photographers of Rodong Sinmun sent me photographs of the frostworks they had taken at the Samjiyon County Town. They are said to have taken the snapshots after waiting a long time for the day when frostworks would form. The frostworks forming at the Samjiyon County Town and Rimyongsu are beautiful, but those at the Phothae area are lovelier; they are spectacular. The snowscape in the Phothae area with trees white with frostworks is more attractive than that in the Samjiyon County Town. As the Samjiyon County Town is a county seat, its snowscape looks artificial, but the snowscape in the Phothae area exudes natural beauty. The most beautiful snowscape in the Paektu area can be found in the Phothae area. The snowscape of the Mt Paektu area is not only beautiful, it evokes many feelings. Poets should go to real life, and give full descriptions of our soldiers and other people, who are striving to build a great, prosperous and powerful country in support of Songun politics and weathering hardships and trials. They say they would regard it as a firm rule to follow the road I take, visiting frontline posts and meeting the service persons there, so as to produce works that sing the praises of the Songun era. Their determination is a good one. Journalists and writers are the Party’s eternal comrades in the Songun revolution. I love Song of Comradeship, because I value comrades. Kim Jong Il cannot exist separated from his comrades. I owe my existence to you. My love of you is imbued with our Party’s philosophy of comradeship. Once I place my trust and love in somebody, I look after him or her to the end. Journalists and writers should invariably remain true to the lofty title of comrades in the Songun revolution, always keeping the Party’s love of and trust in them deep in their hearts. Competent journalists and writers are treasures of our country. 357 They can perform their historic mission as men of letters with credit only when they are in good health. So they should pay special attention to their health. To achieve final victory, we have a lot of work to do and a long way to go. All journalists and writers should perform their tasks more responsibly, united single-heartedly behind the Party, in order to hasten the day of victory",glad meet journalist writer occasion new lunar

29.01.2003,Kim Jong Il,"These days the Korean revolution, guided by the Party, has been making a victorious advance under the banner of Songun. Thanks to the Songun-based politics pursued by our Party, the revolutionary armed forces have been incomparably strengthened, the defence line of the homeland consolidated and a great change effected in the revolution and construction. By dint of Songun politics we have smashed the anti-DPRK, anti-socialist machinations of the imperialists step by step, defended the country and the revolution and exalted the dignity and prestige of socialist Korea in the eyes of the world. The Songun-based politics of our Party is a politics the invincibility of which has been verified through severe historical ordeals, and an all-powerful sword for victory in the revolution. It is an invariable conviction and will of our Party to defend and carry forward by force of arms the sacred revolutionary cause which was pioneered and has won one victory after another by force of arms. The whole Party, the entire army and all the people must wage a resolute struggle under the banner of Songun and thus build a great, 330 prosperous and powerful socialist nation, achieve national reunification and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche. Our Party’s Songun-based revolutionary leadership, Songunbased politics, is a revolutionary mode of leadership and socialist mode of politics that gives top priority to military affairs, and defends the country, the revolution and socialism and dynamically pushes ahead with overall socialist construction by dint of the revolutionary mettle and combat capabilities of the People’s Army. The underlying aspects of Songun politics are that military affairs are of paramount importance, that the army is the hard core and main force of the revolution, and that the army must be strengthened in every way. The essential characteristic of Songun politics is that it safeguards the security of the country and defends the revolutionary gains by developing the People’s Army into invincible revolutionary armed forces, and that it builds up the driving force of the revolution and deals with all affairs of socialist construction in a revolutionary and militant way with the People’s Army as the hard core and main force. The idea and line of giving importance to force of arms and military affairs, advanced and consistently maintained by President Kim Il Sung, constitute the basis and starting point of our Party’s Songun politics. The struggle of the masses of the people for the cause of independence, the cause of socialism, is accompanied by confrontation of power with imperialism and all sorts of other counterrevolutionary forces. Therefore, military affairs emerge as a matter of key importance on which hangs victory or failure in the revolution and the rise or fall of a country or a nation. A country or a nation can emerge victorious in the revolution and defend the revolution, and carve out its destiny independently only when it has its own powerful revolutionary armed forces. It is the force of arms on which hinge the victory of the revolutionary cause, independence and sovereignty, and the prosperity of a country or a nation. This is the Juche-oriented principle of revolution and the law of revolution, 331 elucidated by President Kim Il Sung and whose soundness has been verified by history. President Kim Il Sung organized an armed unit first in the early period of his revolutionary activities, achieved the historic cause of national liberation by force of arms, and founded the Party and the state afterwards. In each period and at each stage of the revolution after the liberation, he always paid primary attention to military affairs and constantly strengthened the revolutionary armed forces, and thus laid a solid military guarantee for the victorious advance of the revolution and construction. Our Party’s Songun politics is a powerful mode of politics of our era which was created by inheriting President Kim Il Sung’s idea and line of attaching importance to arms and military affairs in general, and by developing them in depth as required by the changing situation. By dint of Songun politics we have been defending the President’s great military thoughts and immortal exploits, further exalting them on a new and higher level, and opening a vista for the victory of the Juche revolutionary cause. The new era of Juche revolution is the Songun era and it is a new and higher stage of our revolution which is developing under the banner of Songun. The Songun revolutionary line, Songun politics, is a scientific revolutionary line and mode of statesmanship that most accurately reflect the demands of the times and the revolution. Our Party started pursuing Songun politics on the basis of its scientific analysis of the international circumstances of our revolution and of the rapidly changing situation. Entering the 1990s, socialism collapsed in the former Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries, giving rise to a great change in the world political structure and balance of forces. Although the imperialists’ mouthpieces and opportunists claimed that a new era of detente and peace had arrived following the “end of the Cold War,” the world can never exist in peace so long as imperialism remains rampant. By taking advantage of the collapse of the global socialist system, the reactionary imperialist forces intensified their 332 offensive against the anti-imperialist independent forces; in particular, the US imperialists, who had emerged as the only superpower in the world, were more tenacious than ever in the pursuit of their policy of aggression and war, in an attempt to realize their ambition of world supremacy, wielding the power of authority and arbitrariness in the international arena and violently encroaching upon the sovereignty of other countries. The imperialist reactionary forces spearheaded their attack towards our Republic, which is advancing constantly under the banner of independence, the banner of socialism. The US imperialists and their followers pounced upon us in all directions, stepping up their moves for military aggression on an unprecedented scale to destroy our Republic by means of force on the one hand, and putting pressure to bear upon us in all spheres of politics, the economy, ideology, culture and diplomacy on the other to squeeze us dry. Due to their anti-DPRK isolate-and-stifle schemes, the Korean revolution came to face the severest trials and hardships of its history; we had to bear the full brunt of the offensive of the imperialist aggressive forces, in direct confrontation with the US imperialists. The showdown between us and imperialism is a confrontation of power; the anti-imperialist military front constituted the major front line, the first lifeline of our revolution, by which the destiny of the country, the nation and socialism would be decided. We had to strengthen and rely on the People’s Army by concentrating our efforts on military affairs. In this way we were able to save the destiny of the country and the nation, and lead the revolution and construction to victory. This is the reason why we say the army means the Party, the state and the people. Had we neglected military affairs and failed to strengthen the army, we might have perished already, far from conducting the revolution and construction. Our anti-imperialist, anti-US struggle is the grimmest war to defend the country and a war in defence of socialism. It was only the People’s Army, the revolutionary armed forces, that could perform its mission and role as the standard-bearer of Songun politics. The 333 Songun politics of our Party embodies the high spirit of annihilating the enemy at all costs, and the unshakeable conviction and will to emerge victorious, on the part of the People’s Army. It is entirely thanks to the heroic efforts of the entire army and the whole nation in single-hearted unity with the People’s Army as its core under the Party’s leadership that we could overcome the difficulties in the way of revolution and win great victories. The practical experience of our revolution has proved that Songun politics, which gives precedence to military affairs and regards the revolutionary armed forces as the pivot, is the most powerful mode of politics of our era and revolution. Songun politics makes it possible to defeat any enemy no matter how formidable, tide over any hardships and trials, and guarantee the victorious advance of the revolutionary cause. The Songun revolutionary line, Songun politics, is a strategic revolutionary line and mode of politics that must be adhered to constantly so long as imperialism exists on the earth and its aggressive machinations continue. The Songun politics of our Party is a unique socialist mode of politics that gives a new scientific clarification and solution to the issue of the main force of the revolution. On the basis of its deep analysis of the development of the times and the changed social and class relations, our Party put forward, for the first time in the history of the revolutionary movement, the idea of precedence of the army over the working class, giving prominence to the People’s Army as the core unit and main force of the revolution. The originality of Songun politics and its invincibility lie in the fact that it gives prominence to the People’s Army as the core unit and main force. The preceding revolutionary theories of Marxism viewed the working class as the main force of the revolution. Having analysed the social and class relations in the Western capitalist countries in the mid-19th century, Marx identified the working class as the most advanced and revolutionary class entrusted with the mission of liquidating the domination of capital and all sorts of exploitation, and 334 building socialism and communism, and defined it as the leading class and the main force of the revolution. This was the reflection of the reality of capitalist society in those times. Later, socialist revolutions emerged victorious in several countries of the world, and socialist construction got under way, with the working class as the main force. As a result, it had been recognized as an unbreakable revolutionary formula in carrying out the cause of socialism to conduct the revolutionary struggle and construction work with the working class as the core and the main force. However, Marx’s theories and formulas, which had been set forth one and a half centuries before, cannot accord with the present reality. The times have advanced further, witnessing a great change in social atmosphere, class relations and the status of the working class. With the development of capitalism, especially with the rapid development of science and technology and the arrival of the IT age, the living basis of the working class has been changed and work is being done on a more technological and intellectual basis. The ranks of the working class have been intellectualized and the working masses engaged in technical, intellectual and mental labour are quickly outnumbering manual workers. Moreover, the development of capitalism consolidates the domination of monopoly capital and adds to the prevalence of reactionary bourgeois ideology and culture, which greatly acts to control the class consciousness, awakening and revolutionary assimilation of the working class. The working class of the present times cannot be identified with the working class in the period of industrial capitalism or proletarian revolution, in the light of either the situation of the times or the actual reality of the labour, social status and labour movement of the working class. The changed situation and the reality require a new ideology and theory, strategy and tactics with which to awaken and rally the broad sections of the masses who oppose the domination of monopoly capital and the aggression and war policy of imperialism, train hardcore elements among them and expand and strengthen the revolutionary forces. The limitations of Marxist revolutionary theories were also 335 manifested in a socialist society where the working masses, including the working class, have become the masters of the state and society. The preceding theories based on the materialistic conception of history considered that the revolution is completed once the working class seizes power and establishes socialist relations of production. For this reason, they failed to make a correct clarification of the lawgoverned course of socialist construction subsequent to victory in revolution; in particular, they failed to raise the issue of remoulding man, the ideological revolution, in a socialist society. For the first time in history, President Kim Il Sung advanced the outstanding idea that the course of building socialism and communism is, in view of the class relations, the process of modelling the whole society on the working-class pattern and gave scientific explanations of the role of the working class, the development of class relations and the law governing the remoulding of man in a socialist society. Thanks to his original theory on building socialism and under his wise leadership, the working class and other working masses have been transformed into socialist workers in our country and they all work and live basing themselves on the collectivist principle under the socialist system. Our Party has firmly equipped the masses of the people with the Juche idea and upgraded the process of transforming the whole of society on the revolutionary and working-class patterns by giving definite precedence to the remoulding of man, the ideological work, in the socialist cause. Thus it has brought about a radical change in the socio-economic lives and politico-ideological traits of our people. The Korean people are revolutionary and boundlessly faithful to the Party and the revolution since they have been educated and trained in a revolutionary way in the embrace of the socialist motherland under the guidance of the Party and the leader. These days the masses of the people, who are solidly united behind the Party and the leader with one mind and will, constitute a powerful driving force of socialist construction in our society. Needless to say, class differences still remain between the working 336 class and the cooperative farmers, and the revolutionary and workingclass assimilation of intellectuals cannot be said to have been completed. The working class is as advanced a unit of our society as ever, and has a higher sense of class consciousness, collectivism and revolution than other working masses. Furthermore, it is still in charge of industry, the leading sector of the national economy; especially the workers in the key industries and munitions industry play a very important role in the revolution and construction. That is why our Party treasures the working class and always pays deep concern to further revolutionizing it and enhancing its role. Applying Songun politics, our Party has given prominence to the People’s Army over the working class, prompted by a new viewpoint and attitude towards the issue of the main force of the revolution and the role of a revolutionary army in the revolution and construction. The question of the main force of the revolution is one of the fundamental problems in strengthening the motive force of the revolution and in developing the revolutionary movement by enhancing its role. Which class, stratum or social collective becomes the main force of the revolution is decided by its position and role in the revolution and construction, its sense of revolution, organizational discipline, and combat capabilities. The question of the main force of the revolution cannot remain invariable in any era, society or revolution, nor is it a question that can be solved only on the basis of class relations. Hence, regarding the working class as the main force of the revolution anytime and anywhere is an expression of a dogmatic viewpoint towards the preceding theories and is not correct in principle either. Unfettered by any established theories or formulas, our Party strictly rejected any expression of dogmatic attitude to and revisionist distortion of the preceding theories, and strengthened the army and upgraded its role as required by the development of the situation and the revolution, thus leading the revolution and construction to victory. For our Party to give prominence to the People’s Army as the main force of the revolution is essential to the accomplishment of the 337 revolutionary cause of Juche, in view of the position and role of the People’s Army in our revolution at present and in the light of its revolutionary mettle and combat efficiency. The People’s Army is the revolutionary ranks that defend the first lifeline of our revolution. It defends the Party and the revolution, the country and the people by force of arms and at the cost of life in direct confrontation with the strong imperialist enemy. On the bayonets of the People’s Army hinge peace, socialism and worthwhile and happy life of our people. This is the noble mission and the heaviest yet most honourable revolutionary task of the People’s Army, for which neither the working class nor any other social group can substitute. The People’s Army is the most revolutionary, militant and powerful revolutionary group in our society. No group is equal to the People’s Army in terms of the sense of revolution and organization and combat efficiency. Our People’s Army is unfailingly loyal to the Party and the revolution and very strong in ideology and faith, and it is the most organized combat unit. It defends the Party and the leader and carries out the Party’s policies at all costs, and fights to the death for the cause of the Party, the cause of socialism. The officers and men of the People’s Army, who defend the country and the revolution by force of arms in the van, love their country more dearly than anyone else, are eager to defend socialism and fight uncompromisingly against imperialism and the class enemy with intense hatred. The People’s Army is a revolutionary unit that brims over with revolutionary faith, iron will and militant spirit. It is stronger than any other collective in the sense of collectivism, organization, discipline and unity. The entire army is single-heartedly united behind its Supreme Commander, and moves as one under his command and directive; it arranges all of its soldiers’ routine life and activities as required by military rules and discipline. The collectivist principle and organization and discipline have become the lifeblood and requirements of the routine life of the People’s Army. 338 The high sense of revolution and organization of the People’s Army is reflective of the characteristic of the armed unit and the mettle unique to the revolutionary army, and constitutes a basic factor of upgrading the combat efficiency of our army and improving its politico-ideological might. It is not that any army that takes part in the revolution or any socialist army acquires the traits and qualities befitting a revolutionary army and, moreover, can become the main force of the revolution. The working class or the army can become a revolutionary class or revolutionary armed forces and play an important role in the revolution only when it is awakened and organized under the leadership of a revolutionary party. Apart from the correct leadership of the party and the leader, it is impossible to train any hardcore unit of the revolution or to awaken and rally the broad sections of the masses around the revolutionary ranks. Our People’s Army has grown up into genuine revolutionary armed forces, an invincible army to perform its honourable mission and duty with credit as the hardcore unit and main force of the revolution, thanks to the leadership of President Kim Il Sung and the great Workers’ Party. President Kim Il Sung built our People’s Army into a prototype of a revolutionary army and laid eternal foundations for its development by thoroughly applying the principles and ways he had put forward for the building of Juche-type revolutionary armed forces. He built the People’s Army into an army of the Party and the leader, a genuine army of the people, and developed it as an armed unit of ideology and faith, possessed of all the politico-ideological traits required of a revolutionary army. Under his wise leadership an independent and modern munitions industry was created and so developed as to serve as the material and technical foundations for the modernization of the entire army. The imperishable exploit he performed for the building of the armed forces is the most valuable of his revolutionary achievements and it is now proving its worth as the solid foundation and priceless asset for our Party to further strengthen the People’s 339 Army and pursue Songun politics. On the basis of his great achievements in army building, our Party gave prominence to the People’s Army as the standard-bearer and main force of Songun-based revolution, and directed all its efforts to upgrading it. Through the continuous field inspections of the units of the People’s Army, our Party always went deep among the servicepersons and took care of them with love and trust. It strengthened the army through revolutionary education and training by decisively intensifying Party political work within the army and unsparingly supplied everything necessary for the army. The Party took revolutionary measures to firmly equip the People’s Army with our own unique strategy and tactics, and radically improve its military and technical preparedness as required by the characteristics of modern warfare and tense situations. Our Party’s energetic guidance has given rise to a fresh turn in the politico-ideological traits and fighting spirit of the People’s Army, making its combat efficiency and might better than ever before. Being an army of the Party and the leader and an army of the Supreme Commander, in name and in reality, our People’s Army has grown up to be revolutionary ranks of loyalists full of the spirit of defending the leadership of the revolution at all costs, and the entire army from the Supreme Commander to the rank and file has formed a harmonious whole on the basis of revolutionary comradeship. The Party’s leadership over the army has its firm place within the People’s Army, a revolutionary and military spirit prevails in the entire army, and the good traits of unity between superiors and subordinates, between officers and rank and file and between commanding officers and political officers are manifesting themselves to the full within the army. The noble politico-ideological traits, revolutionary spirit and fighting mettle of the People’s Army are expressed in a concentrated way in the revolutionary soldier spirit. The revolutionary soldier spirit, which was created and has been given full play within the People’s Army under the leadership of the Party, is the lofty revolutionary spirit of our army, characterized mainly by a spirit of 340 defending the leader at the risk of one’s life, a spirit of carrying out tasks at all costs, and a heroic self-sacrificing spirit. It is a deathdefying spirit with which the soldiers of the People’s Army fight for the Party and the leader, for the country and revolution at the cost of their youth and lives; it is a revolutionary spirit of sure victory, a spirit of confronting any enemy no matter how formidable head-on and breaking through any difficulties and trials. The revolutionary soldier spirit of the People’s Army is a noble revolutionary spirit symbolic and representative of the great Songun era. And it constitutes the most revolutionary and militant ideological and spiritual weapon, which makes it possible to create miracles and perform meritorious deeds in the course of the revolution and construction. In the Songun era the working class, too, can perform its class duty and mission only when it is equipped with the revolutionary soldier spirit, and all the other working people can maintain and add lustre to their honour of being the masters of the state and society, their honour of being the socialist working masses, only when they learn from the revolutionary soldier spirit. When the entire army and all the people live and struggle with the revolutionary soldier spirit and fighting spirit, united single-heartedly behind the Party, there will be no enemy in the world strong enough to resist us and no fortress we cannot conquer. Since our People’s Army is the creator, personifier and pioneer of the revolutionary soldier spirit representative of the times and the most powerful combat unit that defends the first lifeline of our revolution, it is the standard-bearer, hardcore unit and the main force of the Songun revolution and, has been exalting the honour to a high degree. Songun politics, which gives prominence to the People’s Army as its main force, makes it possible to firmly maintain and apply to the letter the fundamental ideals and the basic principles of the revolution. Socialism is the fundamental ideal of our revolution to fully realize the independence of the masses of the people, and socialist society is a society which embodies the class demands and 341 aspirations of the working class. Apart from the intrinsic desire and class principle of the working class, it is impossible to realize the independence of the masses of the people and complete the socialist cause. We are striving to build a great, prosperous and powerful socialist nation and reunify the country in the midst of a severe class struggle against the US imperialists and other enemies. The complex and grave situation of our revolution demands that the edge of class struggle be sharpened and the working-class principle, the revolutionary principle, be maintained more thoroughly in all spheres. Our Party has upheld the banner of Songun in the acute confrontation with imperialism. Our rifle is the rifle of class, the rifle of revolution, and it is the most powerful weapon for anti-imperialist class struggle. The revolutionary soldier spirit of the People’s Army is the highest expression of class consciousness and the revolutionary spirit of the working class. Today our Party is totally serious and uncompromising about its demand for adherence to the class principle, the revolutionary principle, in all spheres of the revolution and construction and for further intensification of class education and revolutionary education among the soldiers and the people, as required by the Songun era. When our army and people are firmly equipped with a high level of class consciousness and the revolutionary soldier spirit in support of the Party’s Songun-based leadership, the socialist class position will be further cemented, and the socialist cause will be defended and completed with victory under any circumstances. The Songun politics of our Party is the most powerful and dignified politics of independence which embodies the Juche idea. Independence is the life and soul of a social being, the masses of the people, a country and a nation. The man-centred Juche idea is an idea of independence, and all revolutionary struggles are ones for independence. The Juche idea correctly combines love for the masses of the people with that for the country and the nation, and the independence of the masses of the people, with that of the country and the nation, and scientifically elucidates the ways for its 342 realization. The politics that defends and realizes the independence of the masses of the people, the country and the nation on the basis of the fundamentals and principles of the Juche idea is the most revolutionary and scientific politics, and it also constitutes genuine politics of love for the country, the nation and the people. Our Songun politics that relies on the invincible revolutionary armed forces is a principled and righteous politics of anti-imperialist independence and politics of love for the country, the nation and the people, the politics which reliably defends and guarantees the independent demands and interests of the masses of the people, and the sovereignty and dignity of the country and the people from infringement by the imperialist reactionaries. As self-defensive revolutionary armed forces, our People’s Army is defending by force of arms the dignity of our Party and revolution, our ideology and system and our country and people, smashing the enemy’s war provocations and safeguarding the security and peace of the country. Thanks to Songun politics we are conducting the revolution and construction fair and square in our own way and as suited to the reality of our country and the interests of our revolution, and according to our own ideology and faith, holding up the banner of independence in spite of such complicated and acute situation as today. It is because we have strong military power and an evervictorious strategy and tactics that we are firmly maintaining the independent principle in politics, resolutely rejecting all manner of outside interference and pressure, and pushing ahead with all our endeavours boldly as we intend, unfettered by anything. Thanks to Songun politics, our independence remains firmly guaranteed and our socialist motherland is demonstrating its dignity and honour, authority and might as a fortress of independence. Our Party’s Songun politics is literally a politics for the people and a politics geared to defending and ensuring the independent rights and fundamental interests of the masses of the people. For this reason, the entire people support it absolutely and uphold it with loyalty. The unfurled banner of Songun upheld by our Party has become a great 343 national banner inspiring the consciousness of national independence, self-respect and sense of national pride and honour among the fellow countrymen in the north, south and abroad, and opening up the road to the national reunification and prosperity. Our Party’s Songun idea, Songun politics, has proved its validity, superiority and great vitality, and is demonstrating them all the more with each passing day in the practice and reality of our revolution. First of all, the military position of our revolution has been fortified impregnably under the Party’s Songun-based leadership. The military might of the country constitutes the foremost national power in the struggle for independence and socialism and against imperialism. If one defeats the enemy on the military front one will emerge victorious on all other fronts. Our People’s Army has grown up to be invincible revolutionary armed forces, and our socialist motherland has emerged as a military power in the international arena. We have won one victory after another in the fierce political and military showdown with the imperialists, and defended the country, the revolution and socialism from all manner of aggressive machinations of the enemy. The distinguished successes and achievements we have made in the military field are precisely the great victory of our Party’s Songun-based leadership, Songun politics, and clear manifestation of its validity and might. The military position of the revolution that has been cemented into an impregnable fortress, with the People’s Army as the core, thanks to our Party’s Songun-based leadership serves as a basic guarantee for the completion of the Juche revolutionary cause. Our revolutionary ranks have been united more solidly than ever and the single-hearted unity of our whole society has been further strengthened in the Songun era. Today the People’s Army and the people have forged a genuine comradely relationship whereby they share weal and woe on the road of Songun-based revolution under the leadership of the Party, and the whole society is brimming over with the beautiful trait of unity between the army and the people. The servicepersons are serving the 344 people with devotion while the latter are taking loving care of the former as their own flesh and blood, assisting them with all sincerity, and devotedly learning from the revolutionary soldier spirit and fighting spirit of the People’s Army. As a result, both the servicepersons and the people share the same idea and fighting spirit. In the Songun era the People’s Army is playing a pivotal, vanguard role in all spheres of the revolution and construction, while the people are treasuring the former above all else, and displaying the trait of supporting and assisting the army to the full, resulting in further solidity of comradely unity between the army and the people. As a result of our Party’s Songun-based leadership and politics of love for the soldiers and the people, the single-hearted unity of our society has been upgraded to a single-hearted unity of the whole Party, the whole army and the whole nation based on one ideology and faith, and comradely love and obligation. Furthermore, the politico-ideological might of our revolution has been further strengthened to an incomparable degree. The great viability of Songun politics has been confirmed in the process of socialist construction. As the main force of the revolution, the People’s Army stands in the van in all spheres of socialist construction and has been performing labour feats, setting a shining example. The officers and men of the People’s Army have erected numerous monumental edifices and modern factories through their heroic struggle in full support of the Party’s idea and policies, and made breakthroughs in the difficult yet important sectors of the national economy. They were the first to overcome manifold hardships and trials and created miracles and brought about innovations in all spheres, thus inspiring the working masses throughout the country to a revolutionary upsurge. Taking their cue from the revolutionary soldier spirit and the fighting spirit of the People’s Army, the working class and other working masses created the Kanggye spirit and kindled the torch of Ranam, bringing about a sweeping innovation in overall socialist 345 construction. By dint of Songun politics relying on the People’s Army as the main force, we were able to endure the severest Arduous March and the forced march, open up a road towards building a thriving socialist nation and push forward with the revolution and construction in a bold and positive way despite the difficult situation. Our experience shows that if all the officials and the working people uphold the Party’s Songun-based leadership and work as the People’s Army does, it is possible to conquer the fortress of cutting-edge science and technology, build an economic power, establish an assiduous manner in the management of livelihood and a noble way of cultural and emotional life throughout society, and provide our people with affluent lives in a short period of time. Our Party’s Songun politics has registered a turning point in the cause of national reunification, furthered the international solidarity with our revolution and radically expanded the external relations of the country. Songun politics, which is imbued with the principle of national independence and the spirit of love for the country and the people, our policies for national reunification based on it and our positive efforts gave rise to the historic Pyongyang summit, followed by the adoption of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, and the further development of inter-Korean relations of reconciliation and cooperation in several sectors. The trend of struggle against the US and other foreign forces and for independent national reunification is mounting to a crescendo on an unprecedented scale in south Korea. Songun politics, which opposes imperialist aggression and war policies and defends the independence of the country and the nation, is winning broad support among public circles and the progressive peoples of the world. It gives a blow to the aggressive forces of imperialism and encouragement to the anti-imperialist independent forces in the international arena, stimulating the cause of making the whole world independent. Upholding the banner of Songun under the leadership of the great Party, our army and people have traversed a glorious road of victory, 346 pushing their way through raging storms and creating miracles in history. The Songun-based revolutionary line of our Party is a great revolutionary line of our era and an ever-victorious banner of our revolution. In the Songun-based revolution lie the building of a great, prosperous and powerful nation, national reunification and the victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche. Now that the situation is very complicated and tense at home and abroad, we must hold the banner of Songun higher. The whole Party, the entire army and all the people must advance more resolutely towards a new great victory of our revolution in support of the Party’s Songun-based leadership. First of all, great efforts should be directed continually at strengthening the People’s Army. The might of Songun politics is precisely the might of the People’s Army; its superiority and might can be given full play only when the People’s Army is soundly prepared politically and ideologically, militarily and technically. The Party’s leadership is the lifeblood of the People’s Army. Our People’s Army should be strengthened as the first defender of the Party, as the revolutionary armed unit that fights to the death in support of the Party’s idea and leadership, so that it can inherit and add lustre to its glorious history and tradition as the army of the Party and the leader. The more complex and tenser the situation is, the more efforts should be made to intensify politico-ideological education and military training within the People’s Army so that all the servicepersons trust and follow only our Party under any circumstances and conditions, heighten their revolutionary vigilance and maintain their preparedness. The People’s Army should be fully ready to mercilessly annihilate the imperialist aggressors whenever and wherever they attack. The politico-ideological and military positions of our revolution must be fortified rock-solid by firming up single-hearted unity of the army and the people. There is nothing to fear or impossible to do when the army and the people fight with single-hearted unity under the Party’s leadership. The tradition of army-people unity–both treasuring and loving each other and sharing weal and woe–should be 347 given further play in the Songun era. It is important to establish a sound habit of attaching importance to military affairs throughout society. The work of consolidating the defence capabilities of the country is an undertaking shared by the entire Party, the whole country and all the people. Our officials and working masses must organize and conduct all work on the principle of giving precedence to military affairs, and make energetic efforts to build up the military might of the country. In addition, the paramilitary forces must be strengthened and the whole country turned into a solid fortress. It is imperative to expedite overall economic construction while giving precedence to the defence industry, as required by the Songun era, so as to support the Party’s Songun politics both materially and technologically, and radically improve the people’s living standards in a short period of time. All the officials and working people must cherish the validity and invincibility of the Party’s Songun idea, Songun politics, as their unshakeable faith, work and live as required by it at all times and strive to make the whole society overflow with such revolutionary mettle and militant spirit as can be found only in the People’s Army. Our People’s Army and people have burnished the new era of the Juche revolution as a great Songun era under the leadership of the Party. We will victoriously advance the revolutionary cause of Juche and bring it to completion under the banner of Songun. All the officials, Party members and other working people must become ardent followers of the Songun idea and staunch defenders and implementers of Songun politics, and loyally uphold our Party’s

28.10.2003,Kim Jong Il,"Since the Party put forward the slogan “We serve the people!” many changes have become evident in our officials’ way and spirit of working. In particular, in the course of learning from the Kanggye spirit created in the days of the Arduous March and forced march, they displayed more than ever before the spirit of working faithfully for the people. In those days they mixed with the people, sharing good times and bad with them, and, standing in the vanguard, achieved breakthroughs in carrying out the most challenging tasks. They also took the lead, working with complete sincerity, in such projects as developing small- and medium-sized power stations, land realignment, double-cropping, and building salt works, rural houses and goat farms. These officials are held in high esteem by the people. I have met many officials during my field guidance trips who are working faithfully for the people, and I have spoken highly of some of them in person. The people refer to officials who work with devotion for them as our chief provincial Party secretary, our chief county Party secretary, our general manager, our management board chairman and our primary Party secretary, and they respect a neighbourhood head who cares for them as she would members of her own family, calling her our neighbourhood head. 399 In the army there are many officers and political workers who work with devotion for their soldiers and thus earn their respect and love. One such is the political instructor of the reconnaissance company directly under a mechanized brigade, which I inspected recently, who has subsequently been promoted to political commissar of a reconnaissance battalion. Even after his promotion, the men of his former company still remember him, calling him our political instructor. Being fond of the word “our,” I repeat it in my mind now and then, and I am especially pleased whenever I hear, during my inspections of army units or civilian establishments, the soldiers or people call the senior officer of their respective units “our so-and-so.” Such officials are my revolutionary comrades-in-arms, my true comrades, with whom I can cast in my lot. The word “our” is highly significant. When soldiers or people call the senior officers of their units “our so-and-so” and not simply “soand-so,” the vocative has a different meaning. “Our” connotes neither an official post, nor an honorary title; it is the highest distinction and esteem awarded by soldiers and people to officials who devote themselves to their good, and it is an expression of the respect, affection, trust and intimacy they feel for their true servants. It mirrors the genuine feature of our society, where the leader, the Party and the masses form an integral whole and all the people trust and love one another. Ours is a genuine people’s country and socialist society, centred on the masses. In this society the soldiers and people do not exist for the sake of the officials; the officials exist for the sake of the soldiers and people. The masses are the masters of the country, and the officials are the servants of the people. For officials who serve the people, there is no honour and pride greater than enjoying the people’s support and affection while being called “our so-and-so” by them. Such honour does not come on a silver salver, nor is it awarded just because one desires it. It is awarded to officials who work with devotion for the benefit of the people with a sense of duty as servants 400 of the people. Because I want officials to be called “our so-and-so” by the people, I have emphasized this matter from time to time in recent years. All officials should become true servants of the people and be called “our so-and-so,” in line with the Party’s wishes. Then, the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks, the foundation of our revolution, will be further consolidated, the soldiers and people will have greater trust in the Party and follow it, our country will become prosperous, and the people’s standard of living will be improved. If officials are to be called “our so-and-so” by the people, they should defend the people’s interests and serve them faithfully, in response to the Party’s slogan, “We serve the people!” Our revolution and our socialism defend and realize the people’s demands and interests. The people’s interests are the only yardstick by which the attitude and practice of our officials in serving the people faithfully can be judged. They should value the people’s interests, think about the people’s interests before anything else whenever they are planning a project, and set the realization of the people’s interests as the priority whenever they are organizing and promoting a project. If an official pays no heed to the people’s demands, thinking that it is all right if he lives well at the expense of the people’s interests, he cannot be called an official who serves the people. Officials should always place the people’s interests at the centre of their thinking and practice, and work with devotion for them; they should never infringe on the people’s interests, whatever the circumstances. Whatever they are doing in whatever capacity, they should find the value and worth of their life in bringing the people’s happiness and ideals to fruition, and work with devotion for them. Only officials, who work persistently for the interests of the people and accomplish tangible results with the attitude that the people must enjoy happiness even though they themselves may experience hardship, can command the people’s affection and respect. It is particularly important today for officials, in serving the people, to strive to solve the problems affecting the people’s livelihood. The people’s livelihood is the matter of greatest concern 401 for our Party today. Having had to carry out the revolution and construction in a situation of unprecedented direness, our people have not experienced a moment of affluence or peace, but they have never complained or shown any sign of it, as they have cast in their lot with the Party. In the days of the Arduous March and forced march, when the country was experiencing great difficulties, they tightened their belts and turned out as one in the struggle to defend socialism and build a great, prosperous and powerful country under the Party’s leadership. No people in the world are as faithful and loyal to their Party and leader as our people. What can we not do if it is for the benefit of these laudable people? Waking and sleeping, I think about how to make our people’s life richer. I intend to work wholeheartedly to ensure that our people lead, as soon as possible, a life in which they envy no one and can take pride in themselves. This is our Party’s unshakeable will. And this is why, in the prevailing situation, our Party has established military affairs in the leading position in the affairs of state and, while giving priority to the munitions industry, put forward important policies that have a bearing on the people’s livelihood, such as carrying out a revolution in agriculture, raising large numbers of grass-eating domestic animals, building modern chicken plants and fish farms on a wide scale, restructuring lightindustry factories and increasing their consumer goods production, and building many modern houses in urban and rural areas, and is leading their implementation energetically. If these policies are implemented, our people will be well-off. The point is how officials work. As there is nothing more important than improving the people’s standard of living, officials should be well aware of the Party’s intentions, and work in a determined manner. Even though they may sleep less and experience greater difficulties than those they are responsible for, they must work and work. They should solve without fail the problems of food, clothing and housing in line with the way and spirit of work of the People’s Army, and strive to ensure that the people lead a richer life, enjoying the available social benefits to the full. 402 If officials are to serve the people faithfully, they should arm themselves with the idea that “The people are my God.” The Juche idea authored and put into practice by President Kim Il Sung is immediately the maxim “The people are my God.” He regarded this maxim as his lifelong creed, and devoted his life to the struggle for the people’s freedom and happiness. For the outstanding achievements he made for the cause of the independence of the masses, he still lives in the hearts of our people as their father and leader. The maxim “The people are my God” is also my life’s creed and political philosophy. The slogan “We serve the people!” put forward by the Party, along with the benevolent politics, the politics of love for the people, followed by the Party embody this idea. Taking care of the people to the end of their lives as a matter of responsibility, bringing a flower into bloom even on a rock if that is the people’s wish, and sparing nothing for the people–such is the benevolent politics of our Party. True to President Kim Il Sung’s intention, I regard the people as my God, devote my all to their well-being and look after the masses of the soldiers and people with affection, always mingling with them. I find my happiness and pleasure in the happiness and pleasure they enjoy. The spiritual and moral traits of officials should be identical to those of the Party and their leader. Officials, by regarding the maxim “The people are my God” as their life’s creed and cherishing the view that the masses are the masters of the revolution and construction and the creators of history, should ardently love them, respect them and serve them with devotion. When they cherish the maxim “The people are my God” as their faith and think, behave and work as demanded by it, they will become true officials who share the Party’s intentions and follow it sincerely, and faithful servants of the people. If officials are to serve the people as they should, they must improve their qualifications. The times advance and our fighting objectives are high, and yet their qualifications fail to measure up. However hard they work, they will fail to leave a mark on the minds of the people if they do not improve their qualifications as demanded 403 by the developing situation. Today officials’ work should be judged in part by their qualifications. Bearing in mind that they must have high qualifications if they are to work faithfully for the people at the posts entrusted to them by the people, they should strive to improve their qualifications. They should be well versed in the Party’s lines and policies, the Party’s policies concerning their respective sectors in particular. They should also be knowledgeable about politics, the economy, military affairs and culture; in particular, they should have some knowledge of modern science and technology and learn how to work with a computer. There is no limit to the scope of the knowledge officials should be familiar with. They should make tireless efforts to acquire broad and multifaceted knowledge. Mingling with the masses is an important requirement for officials in serving the people. They should make it their habit, an everyday occurrence, to go among the people. Only by doing so can they perform their duty as servants of the people. They should always mix with the people unceremoniously, and share good times and bad with them, learning what they are thinking and need, what their living conditions are and what difficulties they are experiencing in life, so that they can work to satisfy their needs and solve the problems they are experiencing in life. This is all the more necessary in the case of senior officials; they should listen to the opinions of the masses, promptly grasp the problems arising in the reality and solve them on their own responsibility. Party workers, who are responsible for the people’s destiny and look after it, should pinpoint and promptly solve the problems locked away in the people’s hearts, the problems related to their political integrity, however small they may be, and thus ensure there is not the slightest shadow in their hearts. Officials should always work by relying on the masses and forming a whole with them, motivate them by dint of powerful political work that can touch their heartstrings, and lead them by setting personal examples. Officials should bring about a fresh change in the manner and spirit of their work, as required by the new century. They should be sensitive to the Party’s intentions and demands, 404 and plan their work accordingly on a broad canvas, and develop it aggressively; the more difficult and challenging the situation, the more they should demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of carrying out the Party’s policies without condition by throwing their full weight behind their implementation. They should establish the revolutionary and militant approach of pushing ahead with their work vigorously so as to implement their tasks excellently and carry them out to the end, without interruption, once they have started them. Smashing stereotypes, outmoded patterns and conventional practices and formulae and undertaking all types of work in a creative and innovative fashion is an important characteristic of our Party’s leadership method and work style. Officials, by adopting this method and style, should undertake all types of work in a creative and innovative way in conformity with the stage of our developing revolution and the changed circumstances. Officials should rid their work of formalism and expediency, and undertake it in a conscientious and substantial way with the attitude that they are prepared to answer to the Party for what they have done. They cannot achieve success if they work without studying their work and without any methodology. They should always do their work scrupulously with methodology so that all their undertaking can be fruitful in reality. Officials, who serve the people, ought to be possessed with popular traits. Only then can they mix well with the people and be unceremonious in their relations with them. Officials should always be modest and courteous; those who are not, are not welcomed by the people. This is why I say that officials should have a neck short in front and long behind, meaning that they must keep their heads modestly low in front of the people. Officials should behave in a modest and courteous manner; they should never ride roughshod over the people, holding their heads high as if there is no one better than them. Officials should be humane. Humanity is a popular virtue. Just as a fragrant flower attracts butterflies and honey bees, so a humane 405 official attracts many people. Officials, displaying the warm humanity of thinking of others before themselves and devoting themselves for the sake of others, should warmly love the masses and approach them openly. The practices of abuse of authority and bureaucracy are still evident among our officials. This is a problem. Abuse of authority and bureaucracy have nothing to do with the people-oriented way of work, and they are a taboo for officials, who are supposed to serve the people. Officials must never resort to abuse of authority and bureaucracy. They must never pursue their self-interests or look for privileges and special treatment, and be upright in the economic and moral aspects. Party organizations should continue to wage a powerful struggle to improve the method and style of work among officials, so as to train them all to be reliable people of the Party who are called “our so-andso” by the people and enjoy their affection and respect",since party put forward slogan serve change evident official spirit working particular course learn kanggye spirit create day arduous

07.04.2004,Kim Jong Il,"Forty years has passed since I started working on the Party Central Committee. Forty years, almost half a century, is not a short period. When I look back on the past road of revolution, there are many things that evoke memories in me; among them, what I look back on with the deepest emotion are the memories of the revolutionary comrades who have followed the Party invariably through trials and difficulties. Among them are the veterans of the anti-Japanese revolution, the old revolutionaries; the faithful officials in the period of laying down the Party’s foundations on which the Juche cause could be carried forward; and those who defended the leadership of the revolution with their lives in the days of the Arduous March. Because innumerable comrades have supported, upheld and assisted me through the decades and from one century to the next, I have been able to conduct the revolutionary work successfully. Always mindful of the revolutionary comrades who have been faithful to the Party I will, by dint of comradeship, carry out to the end the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered and led by President Kim Il Sung. Revolution is originally an arduous struggle that is beset by trials, 407 a struggle to break all the social fetters and realize the independence of the masses of the people. In order to advance the revolution with success, one needs many comrades. True comrades are those who share the same ideas, will and destiny, who share life and death in overcoming difficulties and trials together and who share weal and woe on the road of revolution. The word comrade is an honourable and priceless title used between revolutionaries. Without comrades, no revolution can be pioneered or advanced. In this sense, it can be said that the revolution is comrades and comrades are the revolution. For someone travelling the road of revolution, there is no one who is closer and more valuable than his comrades. Since ancient times, it has been said that, for a person, his father, mother, brothers, sisters and relatives are closest to him; it is true that those people with whom he has blood ties are close. But kinship does not necessarily mean he can conduct the revolution together with them. Even though they are his family, they still must share his ideas and will. Otherwise, they cannot take the road of arduous revolution together with him. Worse still, he cannot conduct the revolution by means of human relations that are based on temporary acquaintance or the calculation of personal interest. Only those who can share life and death on the road of revolution are true comrades. To lose a comrade is easy, but to win one is difficult. Only a person who is ready to dedicate his life for his comrades can win genuine comrades. A comrade is someone whom, based on shared ideals, he cannot forsake even if it means sacrificing his life. If he has comrades, he does not fear his enemies, even though there may be millions of them, and he can surmount any difficulty. Comrades are truly the most valuable beings in the world. This is why it is said that not even gold can buy a comrade. A comrade is a revolutionary’s greatest property and capital. A revolutionary can live separated from his parents, but not from his comrades. It can be said that a revolutionary gains his first life from his parents and his second life from his comrades. Since revolutionaries are those who fight to realize their common aims, sharing the same ideas and will, so the relationship between 408 parents and their children, if they are all revolutionaries, should be that between comrades, and surpass the blood relationship. When President Kim Il Sung was young, his father Kim Hyong Jik took him, on his own birthday, to a shop and bought him a pocket watch, saying, “Happy birthday, Comrade Song Ju!” Kim Hyong Jik called young Kim Il Sung “comrade” because he regarded his son as his comrade in the revolution, which surpassed the blood relationship between father and son. President Kim Il Sung later said that he had always kept the vocative in his heart, considering it as his father’s request that he become a revolutionary and fight against the Japanese aggressors to win back the country without fail. President Kim Il Sung treated me in his lifetime as his comrade in the revolution, and I, too, always regarded myself as a revolutionary, a comrade, of President Kim Il Sung. Love given and accepted between comrades on the road of revolution is revolutionary comradeship. Revolutionary comradeship is absolute trust between comrades, the spirit of doing one’s all, even sacrificing one’s life, for the sake of one’s comrades, and of boundless devotion for one another. A key aspect of it is the sharing of ideas and will, irrespective of age or blood relationship. As it is based on the community of ideas, will and fighting goals, revolutionary comradeship is an ideological emotion that is deeper and more ardent than the love of kith and kin and the intimacy between friends; it is the pinnacle of human love. Love between comrades is unity, and there is no power stronger than that of the unity of revolutionary comrades. Love and trust between comrades, unity based on revolutionary comradeship, does not vacillate whatever the adversity, and demonstrates power that no force can equal. Without revolutionary comradeship, we could conceive of neither the existence and development of our Party, nor our single-hearted unity, nor the victorious advance of our revolution. Revolutionary comradeship is the basis of single-hearted unity, the moral strength of our Party and the driving force of our revolution. The concept of revolutionary comradeship is important, in that it is 409 related to the origin of our revolution. Comrade Kim Il Sung’s career and our Party’s history are a history of comradeship, and our revolution, pioneered under the banner of the Down-with-Imperialism Union, is a sacred cause that was opened up and has won victory after victory, by dint of comradeship. Having begun his revolutionary activities in his early years by gaining comrades, President Kim Il Sung opened up a new history of revolutionary comradeship. Based on the view that “A comrade is a second me, and with comrades I can win the whole world,” he never cared about the hardship, even walking a long, long distance at night, if it was for the sake of gaining comrades or for their benefit. He gained comrades first and then weapons, and he conducted the revolution after rallying his comrades and forming a Party organization to motivate them. He named the first Party organization formed at Kalun in the days of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, the Society for Rallying Comrades; it was a name that reflected his far-reaching ambition and revolutionary will to advance and accomplish the Korean revolution by finding and rallying comrades who would share life and death with him. As you must know from reading his memoirs, President Kim Il Sung, once he had formed comradely relations, treasured his comrades and honoured them, trusted them and did everything he could for them. The many legendary anecdotes told about his love and trust for his comrades–that of the bowl of parched-rice flour in the days of the Arduous March, that of the memorial address he spent all night writing for his revolutionary comrade who had fallen in action, and that of enlisting into the main unit of the Korean People’s Revolutionary Army 100 guerrillas who had been suspected of being pro-Japanese “Minsaengdan” members after burning their documents in front of them–reveal how ardent and noble his revolutionary comradeship was. For nearly half a century until the last day of his life, he kept in his safe a photograph of himself with Kim Chaek taken just after the liberation of the country, and this moved everyone who heard about it. While he displayed the dignity of a brilliant, valiant commander in front of the 410 enemy, he was a great man, a great comrade, who spared no affection for his comrades and shed tears for them; he was the supreme incarnation of revolutionary comradeship. Because he cherished noble comradeship and virtue, he was always surrounded by many comrades. In the days of his revolutionary struggle, young communists such as Kim Hyok and Cha Kwang Su acclaimed him as the centre of their unity, the centre of leadership at the dawn of our revolution, and they laid down their lives for him without hesitation. As the successors to the antiJapanese revolutionary forerunners, hundreds of thousands of revolutionary soldiers fought resolutely in loyal support and defence of him. Whenever he had the opportunity in his lifetime, he always pointed out that it had been thanks to the love of his comrades that he had been able to lead our revolution to victory over such a long period from the days of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, adding that he had lived among his comrades ever since taking leave of his parents at the tender age of 14. That revolution starts by gaining comrades is a precious truth I have inherited. Since I value this truth, I love my revolutionary comrades most and believe in them as I do myself. Because he has comrades, Kim Jong Il exists; without them Kim Jong Il could not exist–this is my ideological creed. The belief that my comrade is me and I am him–this is my view of a comrade. I have a special fondness for Song of Comradeship, simply because I treasure my comrades. The song describes in philosophical depth reverence for and loyalty to the leader and the love for revolutionary comrades. In the song’s lyric, I like best the words We must take the revolutionary road rain or snow / Let us be true to our oath / We look up to Hanbyol, our lodestar. These words imply that one must remain true to one’s oath to the leader of the revolution, without vacillation or hesitation, whatever the adversity. Revolutionary comradeship is our Party’s revolutionary philosophy, its political philosophy. Our Party’s benevolent and allembracing politics are politics based on the idea of serving the people 411 as heaven, which is a reflection of the Juche idea; politics of love for and trust in the people, which brim over with the noble idea of comradeship. The Songun politics our Party is unfolding also embodies the idea of revolutionary comradeship. I view our soldiers not in the context of the relationship between men and their Supreme Commander, but as revolutionary comrades who share my ideas and will, and I love them boundlessly. However remote and difficult of access, I visit the places where my soldiers are, showing them my trust and affection and making them my comrades in the Songun revolution. The soldiers place absolute trust in me and follow me, calling me, the Supreme Commander, their closest comrade. Our Party holds the revolutionary veterans, the pioneers of our revolution, in high esteem and immortalizes the martyrs who made such great contributions to the revolution. The Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery on Mt Taesong and the Patriotic Martyrs Cemetery in Sinmi-ri will shine for ever in our Party’s history as symbols of noble comradeship. A large contingent of revolutionary comrades has grown up under the banner of Songun, and the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks is gaining strength on the basis of revolutionary comradeship. In our country today, such traits of comradeship as covering an exploding hand-grenade with one’s body to save one’s comrades, dedicating the prime of one’s life to taking care of an honoured disabled soldier as his or her spouse, looking after orphaned children as one’s own flesh and blood, and caring for bereft old people as one’s own parents, are fully evident. We can take due pride in the fine traditions of revolutionary comradeship that are flourishing in the new era of the Juche revolution, the Songun era. Our revolution, launched on Mt Paektu, is yet to be accomplished. The road of revolution is as long and rugged as ever. In order to march forward victoriously along the rugged road of revolution, we must hold up higher the slogan of comradeship. The revolutionary tasks facing us today and the situation prevailing in the country demand that the slogan of comradeship be held higher than ever 412 before. Our Party has formulated a grand plan for building a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country on this land, upholding President Kim Il Sung’s lifetime will, and the entire Party, the whole army and all the people are striving to implement it. The US imperialists are resorting to every manner of scheme to crush our Republic, the bulwark of socialism, and our country has become the setting for fierce confrontation between socialism and imperialism. Without a large contingent of revolutionary comrades sharing life and death with us, we can neither emerge victorious in the fight with a powerful enemy who boasts of being the “strongest,” nor build a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country by overcoming the severe difficulties we face today. Holding high the slogan of revolutionary comradeship, we should train all the members of society into comrades in the Songun revolution and make the whole society a world of comrades. The most important thing in this world of comrades is the love between the leader and his people. The leader is the centre of comradeship. A large contingent of comrades is drawn together by the leader’s affection, and the people are linked to one another in a comradely way based on his ideas. Separated from the leader, both love between comrades and the world of comrades are unthinkable. The relationship between the leader and his people must be a truly comradely relationship, based on revolutionary faith and obligation, not that of simply issuing and obeying orders. The people must have absolute trust in their leader, support him faithfully and follow him to the end with complete faith and a clear conscience. In supporting and defending their leader our officials must be sincere and free of selfish motives or affectations; they must not stick to accepted forms and conventions. They must think in the way their leader thinks and intends when they think, say what he would say when they speak, and keep in step with him when they walk. The person who lives and works in conformity with their leader’s ideas and will is his true comrade in the revolution. In our country all the people are revolutionary comrades who 413 work to realize common goals under the Party’s leadership, transcending differences in age, background, position and duties. They should all be faithful to their comradely obligations, trusting and loving one another, and devote themselves to their comrades by regarding another’s troubles as their own. As comrades sharing the same destiny on the road of revolution, they should help and lead one another forward and work together with one mind for the sake of their common goals. Love between comrades should be not only warm and true but also principled; comradeship should be expressed through principled criticism. Between revolutionary comrades criticism is an expression of trust and affection. The more valuable a comrade is, the more determined one should be to criticize his or her mistakes promptly in order to help him or her to correct them. Comradeship should also be exercised properly in the relationship between superiors and subordinates. Superiors and subordinates should share the same understanding and feelings. Subordinates should respect and help their superiors, and the latter should take warm care of the former and lead them. Revolutionary comradeship is formed and consolidated through the practical struggle to carry out the Party’s lines and policies. The people should be encouraged to cultivate the spirit of comradeship and establish the climate of working by pooling their determination and ideas in the struggle to carry out the Party’s lines and policies. The single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks should be consolidated, based on revolutionary comradeship. Single-hearted unity is the foundation of our revolution and an invincible weapon more powerful than an atomic bomb. The single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks should be forged, based on revolutionary comradeship and obligation; only then can it become genuine and solid. Revolutionary comradeship and unity are more precious to us than life, since we are defending socialism and conducting a hard struggle in confrontation with a powerful enemy. By exercising revolutionary comradeship in a thoroughgoing way, we should rally all the members of society around the Party and consolidate the 414 single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks so that they are as strong as steel. The People’s Army should take the lead in exercising revolutionary comradeship. The People’s Army is the armed ranks defending the Party, the revolution, the motherland and the people by force of arms. The source of its might lies in its political and ideological superiority, the most important element of which is its unity based on revolutionary comradeship. Arms that are combined with revolutionary comradeship will always be victorious. The Supreme Commander and his men constitute an integral whole, in which they share life and death. All service people should become the leading revolutionary comrades of their Supreme Commander, sharing his will, his feelings and even his destiny, and the entire army should become a collective of death-defying guards for the revolutionary leadership. We should give full play to the unity between officers and soldiers, between superiors and subordinates, in the People’s Army, so as to turn the entire army into a collective of comrades. This type of unity is a traditional trait of our revolutionary armed forces and one of its most important characteristics. Constantly modernizing the military hardware is important in improving the combat effectiveness of the revolutionary armed forces; but more important still, is to ensure unity between the officers and the rank and file, between revolutionary comrades who are to share their blood and even death in a sacred and just war. All commanding officers should love their soldiers as if they were family, and take loving care of them, and the rank and file should trust and follow their commanding officers with complete loyalty. We should strengthen the comradely unity between the army and the people by developing the relations between them. The soldiers should serve the people with devotion and the people should love the soldiers like their own flesh and blood and support them loyally. The army and the people should defend the Party and support its cause on 415 the strength of their single-hearted unity by achieving unity of their fighting spirit and thoughts under the Party’s leadership. Effective education in revolutionary comradeship should be conducted among the soldiers and people. Above all else, education in the Juche idea should be intensified among them. Without the Juche idea, genuine comradely relations cannot be established, nor can solid unity and cohesion be achieved. When all the soldiers and all the people cherish the Juche idea as an article of their faith and think and act as one in conformity with its requirements, they will display a high level of revolutionary comradeship and our single-hearted unity will be developed further. The soldiers and the people should be equipped with our Party’s tradition of comradeship. What is important in this tradition is the comradeship that is centred on the leader, the comradeship between the leader and his people that is based on trust and obligation. This tradition was created in the crucible of the exceptionally arduous revolutionary struggle, and its vitality has been demonstrated in the practical revolution at several stages. The soldiers and the people should be educated in the Party’s tradition of revolutionary comradeship, so that they equip themselves with the attitude of a revolutionary comrade, and in this way they can be trained into comrades in the Songun revolution who will defend the Party with their lives and faithfully support the Party’s Songun idea and leadership. Models of revolutionary comradeship should be held up and their examples popularized, to encourage the full flowering of the virtue of comradeship across society. We should defend the motherland and the revolution and build a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country on the strength of the single-hearted unity of the Party, the army and the people, based on revolutionary comradeship",forty year pass since start work party central committee forty year almost half century short period back past road revolution there thing evoke memory back deep emotion

11.08.2004,Kim Jong Il,"Capital construction is of great importance in building the socialist economy. It makes it possible to successfully push forward economic construction and socialist construction as a whole, spruce up the appearance of the country and provide the people with good living conditions. President Kim Il Sung paid close attention to capital construction since long and energetically led it in person. He put forward a Jucheoriented idea on capital construction and applied it, thereby opening up a new history of capital construction for the people and achieving an immortal accomplishment for the prosperity and development of the country. True to his intention, our Party has regarded capital construction as a main link in the whole chain of socialist construction, and directed great efforts to it. Inheriting and developing President Kim Il Sung’s Juche-oriented idea on capital construction and his leadership achievements and adding lustre to them on a new, higher level–this is our Party’s consistent policy and an aspect of its leadership of capital construction. The Party systematized his idea on capital construction into the Juche-oriented theory of architecture, and under the banner of this theory, it has effected a revolution in 426 architecture and led industrial construction and all other types of construction to an uninterrupted upsurge. We never suspended construction even in the days of the Arduous March and forced march. Over the past decade, when everything was in short supply, we performed unprecedented achievements in the field of capital construction. Under the energetic guidance of our Party, the Kumsusan Memorial Palace was laid out as a sacred temple of Juche, statues of the President and monuments were erected in the places associated with his leadership achievements, and the revolutionary battle sites and revolutionary sites in the area of Mt Paektu and other areas were built up as bases for education in the revolutionary traditions. Great successes were gained in the overall field of construction, including industrial construction. With a determination to implement the Supreme Commander’s order at the cost of their lives, soldiers built the Anbyon Youth Power Station by displaying unrivalled heroism and the spirit of devotion and self-sacrifice. Several projects for large hydraulic power stations have been stepped up, and projects for small- and medium-sized ones are underway in every part of the country on a large scale. The many newly-built or renovated lightindustry factories, the world-class modern chicken, fish and other livestock farms and various public service facilities are contributing to the improvement of the people’s livelihood. In line with the Party’s plan for a grand transformation of nature, land realignment of lasting significance was conducted on a gigantic scale, the appearance of the crop lands in Kangwon Province and the provinces in the western region was improved as befit those of a socialist state, and the largescale gravitational Kaechon-Lake Thaesong Waterway, unprecedented in the history of irrigation construction in our country, was successfully built. Our young people built the Youth Hero Motorway, which links Pyongyang and Nampho, by giving full play to their heroic mettle and indomitable fighting spirit. The Chongnyu Bridge, Kumnung Tunnel No. 2 and the tourist road between Pyongyang and Hyangsan were built, and the country’s roads as a 427 whole were improved to a considerable extent. Mts Kuwol and Chilbo, Ryongmun Cavern and other scenic places and spots were newly laid out as cultural resorts for the people, as characteristic tourist resorts. The looks of Pyongyang, the capital city of the revolution, were improved as required by the new century, and rural villages are being turned into a picturesque socialist panorama. All these successes in construction constitute eternal wealth for the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people and a valuable asset for economic development of the country. The efforts we have made in the face of hardships, tightening our belts, are being rewarded. Coming generations will say with pride that the structures we have built are the creations of the age of the WPK. We should bring about a fresh upturn in capital construction on the basis of these successes. Making a fresh upturn in capital construction today is an urgent demand of the times and the development of the revolution. We are now striving to build a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country under the banner of Songun. It is only when we make innovations in capital construction in line with the Songun-based revolutionary line of our Party and the line of economic construction in the Songun era that we can lay sound material and technical foundations for the building of a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country. We should be bold in freeing ourselves from outdated patterns and conventional methods, proactively introduce cutting-edge science and technology and renovate the overall construction work, ranging from designing and building operations to the production of building materials. In this way, while undertaking construction in an overall way, we should build all structures as eternal wealth suited to the trend of the times, matching the appearance of a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country and by no means outdated in the distant future. We should effect a fresh upturn in capital construction so as to ensure the speed and quality of construction and the effectiveness of investment at the highest level and to ensure that the magnificent tasks for building a great, 428 prosperous and powerful socialist country are carried out properly and in time. We should conduct the grand yet worthwhile construction work for the building of a powerful state by launching a bold offensive, displaying the revolutionary spirit and fighting mettle of the service persons, and thus demonstrate to the world the revolutionary mettle and might of Juche Korea, which is advancing under the banner of Songun. First of all, it is important to fully implement the principle of concentrated construction in the sphere of capital construction. This is a major principle President Kim Il Sung and our Party have long advocated. If there is no clear target in capital construction, and various sectors and units undertake construction projects, dispersing their forces, construction cannot be carried out properly. Only when the major targets are identified and all forces are concentrated on them will it be possible to make a rational use of the manpower, materials and funds available, resulting in the increase of the speed and improvement of the quality of construction, and the effectiveness of investment and the balanced development of the national economy. Concentrated construction is all the more important today, when the country’s economy is yet to get back on a normal footing and everything is in short supply. We must carry out construction to develop light industry and agriculture while giving definite priority to national defence in accordance with the economic construction line of the Songun era, build dwelling houses and public welfare service facilities, and conduct construction with the aim of rapidly shoring up and developing heavy industry, the basic sector in the development of the national economy. There are lots of things to be done in capital construction, but our capabilities are limited. We cannot get involved in all these construction projects and push ahead with them simultaneously. On the basis of the Party’s intention, actual situation, requirements of the developing economy as a whole and scientific calculation, we should define the order of priority and importance, identify the major projects, concentrate our forces on the key sectors 429 and projects, and complete them one by one in an efficient way. While carrying out capital construction in a comprehensive way, we should rationally combine new construction projects with renovation projects. This will be conducive to realizing the modernization of our economy and developing it rapidly while economizing on funds. Those in charge of the various sectors of the national economy should deeply study the actual situation of factories and enterprises, and, on the basis of this, they should build new ones on a modern footing by applying the latest technologies and technologically upgrade the old and backward production lines. The heavy industry sector should put its main stress on the technological upgrading of the existing factories and enterprises rather than on building new ones, except power stations and other major projects. The principle of combining new construction projects with renovation projects should also be adhered to in urban construction as well as in industrial construction. Success in capital construction is expressed and confirmed in the cost-effectiveness and profit of investment. Increasing the effectiveness of investment and ensuring cost-effectiveness are a specially important issue in capital construction. Unlike producing goods in the manufacturing sector, a project in the capital construction sector takes at least months, and several years in case of a large-scale project. Moreover, funds invested in the projects are only recovered several years after its completion. Capital construction is itself a long-term undertaking that requires a large amount of funds. If construction is not carried out properly, huge amounts of materials and funds will be idle or be otherwise wasted, and if building work is not done at a high standard or the period of construction is delayed, the wastage increases. Concentration in construction and rational combination of new construction projects and renovation projects are both aimed at increasing the effectiveness of investment and costeffectiveness. By effectively organizing capital construction, we should fully guarantee the speed and quality of construction with the maximum economy of manpower, materials and funds, and ensure 430 that the installations that are built bring substantial benefit to the country and to the people. This is a principle which we should consistently adhere to in capital construction. Capital construction should be put on a modern footing. Only when it is put on a modern footing based on the latest science and technology can great innovations be made in capital construction as required by the trend of the times and the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country. We should make every effort to modernize capital construction so as to put it on a par with world standards as quickly as possible. For the modernization of capital construction, a revolution should be effected in designing. Designing is the first process in construction; a design can be called a map of operations. The quality of building work hinges on the design. Therefore, making a revolution in designing is prerequisite to bringing about a new upturn in construction. What is important in this regard is to decisively raise the scientific and technological level of designing as required by the new century, and to renovate the designing methods. The Party’s plan and intention for construction, the requirements of its Juche-oriented theory of architecture and the requirements of its policy of putting construction on a modern footing and increasing the effectiveness of investment should be reflected in capital construction designing. When designing a structure, those in charge should design it in a unique and creative manner with an eye to the distant future. In addition, they should raise the level of specialization in designing, put designing on a scientific, IT basis, and hold prize-winning contests and meetings for joint review of designs to intensify the screening of designs. Such tendencies as lax screening of designs or building a structure without having its design screened should be eliminated. Increasing the production of building materials and their qualities by effecting a revolution in building materials is an important demand for the modernization of capital construction. Building materials of good quality raise the standard of structures and ensure their quality. The building-materials industry of our country still falls behind the 431 trend of the times. By consolidating the building-materials production bases and expanding the building-materials industry, we should produce glass, plastics, lagging, natural materials, ceramic ware and other modern general finishing materials as well as quality cement and bricks in larger quantities. The metallurgical and forestry sectors should provide steel materials of various specifications and timber needed for construction. Building operations should be industrialized and modernized. Only then will it be possible to free the construction workers from arduous and difficult labour, and undertake construction more quickly and at a higher standard with less manpower and materials. However, the construction sector is yet to get rid of such practices as undertaking building work in a slipshod way without observing technical requirements and building methods. This causes building work to be repeated and some structures to be repaired before the cycle of repair after its inauguration. In building operations manual methods should be eliminated, the level of mechanization raised and updated building methods introduced. Industrialization and modernization in building operations require modern equipment and tools. Every effort should be made to introduce modern equipment and tools into construction in keeping with the trend of the latest science and technology. Such practices as building a structure in a careless or slipshod way or as a crash campaign on the occasion of a commemoration day should be eschewed, and all building operations should follow the requirements of the orthodox designs, technical regulations and building methods. Socialist principles should be firmly maintained in capital construction. This means, above all, to conduct construction work on the principles of giving top priority to the interests of the people and guaranteeing their interests. Building every structure in such a way as to meet the demands and interests of the people, to be useful and convenient to them, and to bring benefits to them–these are the first and foremost socialist principles that should be adhered to in capital 432 construction. Even if we are to build a single house or a single street, we should do it in such a way as to satisfy the people’s demands and convenience. And even if we are to build a single factory or power station, we should build it so that it will contribute to the prosperity of the country and the well-being of the people to the maximum extent. In order to carry out capital construction on socialist principles, all construction work should be done in a planned way and under the unified guidance of the state. The socialist economy is a planned economy; apart from a plan, socialist economic construction is inconceivable. If various sectors and units engage in construction separately outside the planned guidance and management of the state, capital construction cannot be undertaken as required by the policies of the Party and the state, and, worse still, huge amounts of manpower, materials and funds will be wasted and the quality of construction cannot be guaranteed. A strict discipline and order, by which correct plans for capital construction are formulated on the basis of the Party’s policy and actual situation and construction is undertaken according to the plans, should be established. Control and guidance for the implementation of the plans should also be intensified. For all that, the units that are engaged in capital construction must not be bound by plans drawn in an unworkably detailed way. In the present conditions, large-scale construction projects of state significance should be implemented with clear-cut plans; for other construction projects the amount of investment for capital construction should be defined for the units that are to implement them, and they should be allowed to implement the projects by themselves within the limit of the funds invested. In capital construction it is important to properly combine construction by specialized construction forces with construction by the masses. The more socialist construction is advanced, the more specialized capital construction should be. We should build up the specialized construction forces and raise the level of specialization in construction in keeping with the direction of development of capital construction. At the same time, we should pay close attention to 433 rationally organizing construction conducted through a mass drive and ensuring its quality and the effectiveness of investment. Provinces, cities and counties should refrain from organizing construction in a disorderly fashion by mobilizing the masses on the pretext of a mass drive, thus inflicting a loss on the country and not ensuring proper quality. Construction undertaken as a mass drive should be put on an organized and planned footing and promoted in cooperation with the specialized construction forces so as to meet the necessary scientific and technological requirements. The capital construction sector should firmly adhere to the principles of concentration and modernization, socialist principles and other important principles put forward by the Party and fully implement them, so as to bring about a renewal of construction as a whole. First of all, we should continue to set up monuments and lay out the revolutionary battle sites and historic sites to add lustre to the greatness and revolutionary exploits of President Kim Il Sung from generation to generation. So far, we have carried out many such construction projects, but since we have entered a new century we should approach them from a new angle and adjust or renovate those that should be adjusted or renovated. Monuments to be set up in praise of him should retain his greatness in their content and form, as well as high ideological and artistic qualities, respectability and durability. Revolutionary battle sites and historic sites should be better laid out on the principle of fidelity to historic truth. We should direct particularly great efforts to building more splendidly the sites in the Mt Paektu area, which retains many of the relics associated with President Kim Il Sung’s anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. Industrial construction must focus on construction in the major sectors and major projects in implementing the line of economic construction of the Songun era put forward by the Party. Definite precedence should be given to defence building on the principle of attaching importance to military affairs, the principle of 434 giving priority to military affairs, and construction for further developing heavy industry related to it should be accelerated. At present the most pressing problem in all the sectors of defence building, economic construction and people’s living is the supply of electricity. In order to solve this problem, the state should focus its efforts on promoting the on-going large-scale power projects, like the Orangchon and Kumyagang power stations, to commission them ahead of schedule while pushing forward with the repair and renovation of thermal power stations. In addition, small- and medium-sized power stations should be built in various parts of the country, and such power resources as wind and tide should be exploited. It is necessary to pay due attention to pit construction of coal and ore mines, the technical upgrading of metallurgical works and other urgent construction projects in the major industries. The construction for modernizing light industry must also be carried out steadily according to annual plans. In future, factories and enterprises should be built near their sources of raw materials and fuel and consumption areas according to the principle of distribution of productive forces and in such a way as to ensure profitability by raising the rate of utilization of production spaces. Industrial construction should direct close concern to preventing pollution and thus fully implement the Party’s policy of establishing pollution-free industry. Railways, roads and ports should be built well. Railway construction should be promoted for regularized operation of railways and increased railway carriage and traffic capacities. Railways should be updated, and construction should be stepped up for heavy-duty carrying capacity. The revolution in road building should be promoted without letup. Roads can be likened to the face of a country, and its civilization is judged by the level of its development of its roads. It is necessary to build motorways, principal roads, industrial roads, and in provincial towns relief roads, to raise the standard of the overall road network of the country by improving the technical conditions of roads and paving them. With the development 435 of water transport and foreign trade, the existing ports should be updated and new, modern ones built. The rural economic sector should continue to channel great efforts into improving the layout of crop fields and carrying out irrigation projects so as to implement the Party’s policy on effecting a revolution in agriculture. The work of improving the layout of crop fields launched by our Party is a grand undertaking to transform nature, a project for laying the main foundations for socialist rural construction. We should continuously push ahead with the project of turning all farmlands in the country into standardized ones to facilitate mechanized farming. Along with this, the Paengma-Cholsan Waterway should be completed at an early date and several other gravitational waterway projects undertaken for the completion of the agricultural irrigation system at a high level. All industrial construction projects, such as building factories, power stations and railways, are, in the final analysis, for production. Therefore, they should be implemented at a high standard and in a substantial way with the main emphasis put on ensuring their quality and the effectiveness of production. If a factory or a production line is built in a slapdash way without scrupulous economic and technical calculations and thus made to run improperly or produce poor results in production, it will entail a colossal economic loss. In industrial construction it is necessary to take into full consideration the scientific and technical requirements of the project, the conditions for the supply of raw and other materials and all other problems arising in managing it, and then build it in such a way as to assure its quality. After its completion, it should be run at a regularly high level of efficiency so that it can prove effective in production. Urban and rural construction should be improved in keeping with the requirements of the new century. Urban construction should be carried out in a long-term way on the basis of a well-considered plan. What is essential in urban construction is to pay attention to applying the Juche character, national identity and the character of the times, and to ensuring the 436 three-dimensional quality and interior depth. Houses, educational and cultural establishments and public welfare facilities should be built in harmonious combination, with priority put on building houses. In building houses, it is necessary to rationally define the number of stories of apartments, fix the number of rooms and distribute them as suited to the people’s everyday needs, finish the interiors of the houses as appropriate to modern tastes, and furnish them with quality furniture. Towns must not be laid out in a monotonous way. Close attention should be paid to decorating the streets and buildings. We should not only try to build new buildings in towns, but renovate the existing buildings in the modern fashion. Urban pavements should be improved, and trees and flowers should be planted. The principle of giving priority to infrastructure building over superstructure building must be strictly observed in urban construction. If infrastructure is not built well, it is impossible to build a town in a far-sighted way and manage it properly. We should give definite precedence to building infrastructure in urban construction. What is essential is to build such structures as sewage facilities, water supply and drainage systems, power grids and communications networks at a high standard. Nationwide efforts should be exerted to build up Pyongyang. Pyongyang is the capital of the revolution and the heart of Juche Korea. The building up of Pyongyang is not a matter of economic and business routine–merely building houses and streets–but an important political matter that has a bearing on the dignity of Kim Il Sung’s country, socialist Korea. Pyongyang should be laid out in a more splendid way so that it can become a world-class city, displaying the majestic appearance of the socialist country. For the present, it is necessary to spruce up its appearance by directing efforts to renovating the main streets and to build more high-rise blocks of flats, ring roads, reservoirs and sewage-treatment facilities. In particular, the water-supply network and heating facilities should be maintained well for the adequate supply of drinking water and heating. 437 We should effect a revolution in rural construction so as to turn all the rural villages into beautiful socialist fairylands good to work and live in. We should build fine single-story houses and cultural and welfare service facilities for the convenience of the farming families. Rural roads should be built up, and fruit trees and various other kinds of trees should be planted around the houses and villages, so that they are covered with trees. Planting trees, improving rivers, laying out scenic spots and other undertakings for land development are a patriotic work of lasting significance, which make the mountains and rivers of the country more beautiful and richer. By upholding the Party’s long-term plan and policy on land development we should conduct land development as a nationwide, patriotic drive. We should push ahead with naturetransforming projects, like covering the whole country with trees and flowers, afforestation and water conservancy, in a planned way and with an eye to the distant future. By better conserving and sprucing up the mountains and rivers of our country, we should turn it into a socialist golden tapestry of the Workers’ Party’s era, which is beautiful and rich in all kinds of resources. In order for capital construction to be raised to a new and higher level, a revolution should be brought about in construction science and technology. Scientific research institutions, and scientists and technicians in the construction sector should fully implement the Party’s line on giving priority to science and technology so as to make great innovations in developing construction science and technology and firmly guarantee capital construction for the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country with science and technology. The major task facing the field of construction science and technology is the successful solution of the scientific and technical problems arising in upgrading capital construction based on the achievements of the latest science and technology. Scientific research institutions and scientists and technicians in the construction sector should exert extra efforts for the study of structural diagrams and 438 building techniques and finding solutions to the scientific and technical problems arising in designing, construction and maintenance of various kinds of structures. They should also intensify study on improving the qualities of cement, steel and other building materials, introducing new building materials in construction and, particularly, developing quality building materials that rely on domestic resources. They should develop and introduce modern building equipment and tools and the cutting-edge techniques of building operations so as to put capital construction on a modern footing and at a high level. For the rapid development of construction science and technology the scientists and technicians in the construction sector should decisively enhance their roles. Clearly conscious of the honorable mission they have assumed for the Party and the country, they should devote themselves to the study of science and technology with a high sense of loyalty and patriotic enthusiasm, and give fullest play to their abilities, wisdom and talents in bringing about great innovations in capital construction. The construction sector should value them, give prominence to them, help them in their work, and provide them with good living conditions. The construction sector should step up the training of reserve scientists and technicians. With this sector now widely introducing cutting-edge technology and using computers and other modern technical means, it will be impossible for it to bring about an upturn in capital construction without training competent scientists and technicians in a larger number and more quickly. The Pyongyang University of Construction and Building-Materials Industry and other educational institutes in the construction sector should, in keeping with the requirements of the developing situation, improve the contents and methods of education and thus train many competent scientists and technicians. Especially, they should produce worldclass designers and architects by intensifying the education of leading intellects in this sector. The construction sector should re-educate onduty officials in a systematic way, and send students and interns 439 abroad in order to raise the qualifications of scientists and technicians in the sector, including designers. We should establish a proper guidance and management system for capital construction, and enhance the functions and role of leadership bodies in the construction sector. We should establish a well-regulated guidance and management system for construction on the principle of giving full play to the creativity of the individual units while ensuring central and unified guidance of the state over capital construction, and ensure that all construction projects are undertaken under the guidance and supervision of the construction organs concerned. The leadership bodies and senior officials in the construction sector should always plan and organize construction projects on the basis of the Party’s policy on capital construction. They should direct primary attention to the projects which the Party is concerned with and concentrate their efforts on it, to fully ensure the quality and dates of completion. The leadership bodies must focus on introducing advanced science and technology and on ensuring that all building operations are done as required by science and technology. The senior officials should frequently go down to the lower units to get acquainted with the real situation and find solutions to knotty problems in a timely and responsible manner while rendering substantial help to them. The construction enterprises, the major units in the construction sector, should improve their business management. The major task in this regard is for them to thoroughly implement the Party’s policy on putting construction on a regular basis. They should organize the building work in a planned way, coordinate manpower administration and building work in detail, eliminate the practices of leaving materials and funds idle or making wasteful use of them, and use equipment and materials efficiently, thus ensuring the normalization of construction and the effectiveness of investment. Supervision over capital construction should be strengthened. The state should establish a unified system of supervision over construction, enhance the authority and role of the construction 440 supervisory organs, and intensify monitor and control so as to ensure that the Party’s policy on capital construction and its embodiment–the resolutions and directives of the state–are carried out. The construction supervisory organs should strictly control construction so that such practices as violating the law of the state or undertaking projects which are not planned or approved are avoided. They should demand that all building processes, from designing to building, observe the set system and order, and inspect the completed structures in a responsible way. Legislation concerning the construction sector should be reviewed overall and revised to meet the requirements of the developing reality. It is necessary to build up the ranks of the officials of construction supervisory organs with persons who have a strong sense of principle and are demanding and competent, and enhance their sense of responsibility. It is very important to strengthen Party guidance over the capital construction sector. Party organizations should take guidance from the Party’s policy on capital construction, and conduct organizational and political work for implementing it. They should lead and help the organs, enterprises and officials in the construction sector to organize and command with a sense of responsibility the implementation of the Party’s policy. In particular, they should direct Party-oriented attention to eliminating such practices as undertaking construction projects rashly and haphazardly, to establishing the socialist economic management order in construction, and to ensuring that all building operations are done in line with the scientific and technical demands. Party organizations and Party officials should conduct political work among builders in a proactive way in conformity with the present revolutionary climate, in which bold offensives are being launched on all fronts of the building of a great, prosperous and powerful country. They should move the focus of their political work to construction sites and conduct it in a high-spirited manner as political officers of the People’s Army do on the battle line, thus motivating builders ideologically and encouraging them to work 441 miracles and innovations on all construction sites. The Party organizations in the construction sector should pay special attention to supply work. Builders, away from their homes, often live in groups in makeshift shelters. Therefore, Party organizations should always exert great efforts to supply work, building dormitories, mess halls and other logistic facilities and organizing sideline farming, so as to provide them with conditions for a more settled life. The capital construction sector has shouldered a momentous task in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful socialist nation. Upholding the Party’s policy on capital construction, all the officials and working people in the construction sector must effect a fresh upturn in construction as required by the times and the developing revolution, and thus gloriously fulfil their difficult and gigantic tasks in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country",capital importance build socialist economy

06.04.2005,Kim Jong Il,"Greeting the Day of the Sun this year, the 40th since the naming of the Kimilsungia, the traditional Kimilsungia Festival is being organized in an extraordinarily grand way. This is quite laudable. Kimilsungia was so named at the suggestion of President Sukarno of Indonesia when the great leader President Kim Il Sung was visiting that country in April 1965. Forty years have passed since then, but I still recall with deep emotion the days when I visited Indonesia with President Kim Il Sung. Historical events evoke deeper emotions with the passage of time. The President’s visit to Indonesia was significant for furthering the international prestige of our Republic, and for strengthening unity and cooperation with the newly-emergent countries. During the ten days of his sojourn in Indonesia, the President took not a day’s rest, but conducted energetic activities to strengthen unity and cooperation with the newlyemergent countries. He met Sukarno and talked with him several times, and met leading Indonesian figures in political, social and academic circles. He delivered a lecture at the Ali Archam Academy of Social Sciences of Indonesia under the title, “On Socialist Construction in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the South Korean Revolution.” As the lecture was permeated with the idea of establishing Juche and maintaining the line of independence in the revolution and construction, it elicited a thunderous response from people of all walks of life in Indonesia. The lecture was a historic one in that it gave a most profound and penetrating analysis of the problem of opposing dogmatism and great-power worship, and establishing Juche in the then-complicated international situation and conditions. Studying the work today, one can feel 1 deeply that the President, with revolutionary insight, foresaw already at that time the future changes and developments in the international situation. While he was visiting Indonesia, the country was celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Bandung Conference. That international conference had been held in the Indonesian city of Bandung in 1955 with the aim of strengthening solidarity between the newly-emergent countries in Asia and Africa. Participating in the celebration events, President Kim Il Sung met the heads of state and government and statesmen from the newly-emergent countries who had come to Indonesia, and held friendly talks with them. As a great event that set up a new milestone in the development of relations with the newly-emergent countries of Asia and Africa, his visit to Indonesia 40 years ago will shine forever in the annals of our country’s diplomacy. During his visit to Indonesia, the leaders and people of that country accorded him their warmest welcome as well as extraordinary hospitality. All the events receiving him were held in a grand way, transcending diplomatic convention, and in Jakarta, the capital city, Bandung, Bogor and other places where he went, huge crowds in holiday attire danced and sang in the streets welcoming him as the most honoured state guest. The hospitality President Sukarno accorded to President Kim Il Sung was an especially warm one. Cherishing high respect for President Kim Il Sung, President Sukarno treated him with utmost sincerity. When President Kim Il Sung was visiting local areas, he always accompanied him and paid special attention to his guest. During the visit, we greeted April 15. That day, President Sukarno paid a call on President Kim Il Sung on the latter’s 53rd birthday, presented a gift to him and ensured that the title of Honorary Doctor of Engineering was awarded to him. Sukarno was a statesman 2 renowned in the international arena in those days, and he respected and revered our President from the bottom of his heart, because he was sympathetic with our President’s ideas and leadership, and attracted to his greatness. One year before President Kim Il Sung visited Indonesia, Sukarno had visited our country. Witnessing the real situation of Korea forging ahead along the line of independence, self-sufficiency and selfreliant defence advanced by President Kim Il Sung, he had been deeply moved, he said. President Kim Il Sung attended a session of the Provisional People’s Consultative Assembly of Indonesia, at which Sukarno made a speech proclaiming that a new society should be built under the banner of self-reliance and self-supporting economy. He said, with strong emotion: “His Respected Excellency Premier Kim Il Sung, the author of the famous doctrine of self-reliance and the daring and successful builder of a self-supporting economy is present here!” When visiting the Bogor Botanical Garden, I felt more deeply how much President Sukarno respected and revered President Kim Il Sung. With a long history, this worldrenowned botanical garden was well worth visiting. With flowers of the orchid family, cactuses and other rare tropical flowers in full bloom, I felt as if I were visiting a world flower fair. When we approached a display in a greenhouse of the botanical garden, Sukarno took a pot of flowers from the director of the botanical garden, and asked President Kim Il Sung how he liked the flowers. The director explained that it was a variety of the orchid family a famous florist of the garden had bred after long, painstaking research, and it was a peculiar flower in that it blossomed twice a year, being in bloom for two to three months. After looking at the flower for a while, President Kim Il Sung said that it was very beautiful and 3 expressed thanks to his host for showing him such a fine flower. Then, Sukarno said sincerely that he wanted the flower to be named after President Kim Il Sung. The director of the botanical garden, too, expressed his wish to call it Kimilsungia. President Kim Il Sung gently declined their suggestion, saying that he had done nothing so special and that there was no need to name a flower after him. Sukarno replied, “No. You have rendered enormous services to mankind, so you deserve a high honour.” He refused to withdraw his request. Back in Jakarta, he repeatedly brought the matter to us. On receiving a report about it, President Kim Il Sung said that if President Sukarno and the Indonesian people wished it so sincerely, he would accept the suggestion as a token of their esteem for our people. This is how a flower named after a great man for the first time in the thousands of years of human history came into the world. From olden times, flowers have been considered symbols of beauty, love, peace and best wishes. Some flowers are named after their shapes or characteristics, and others after persons. In our country there is the Pongsonhwa (balsam−Tr.) flower named after a girl named Pong Son, and in China the Yangguifei (poppy−Tr.) flower named after a Tang Dynasty beauty. There are also flowers named after florists and plant collectors. But none had previously been named after a great man. Naming a rare flower bred at the Bogor Botanical Garden after President Kim Il Sung, i.e. Kimilsungia, was an expression of the high regard prominent figures and people of the world paid to a man who had rendered such brilliant services to mankind. Witnessing the moving scene, I felt deeply what a great man President Kim Il Sung was and how honoured I was to be his man, his disciple. President Sukarno promised that he would ensure that the 4 technique of cultivating the flower would be completed and that it would be sent to our country in one or two years. But the flower failed to come to our country for several years owing to coup d’état in Indonesia. Later, Sukarno left politics, and the director of the Bogor Botanical Garden and the florist who had bred the flower disappeared without a trace. However, convinced that Kimilsungia would have been preserved and grown with care, as there were people who deeply respected and revered President Kim Il Sung in Indonesia, I sent officials to Indonesia in 1974 to find the flower. They traced the flower with the assistance of the local people, found it and fetched two pots of the flower to our country. Looking at the flowers I could confirm that they were identical with the Kimilsungia I had seen 10 years previously at the Bogor Botanical Garden. Kimilsungia is a beautiful flower; the more one looks at it, the more one feels attracted and attached to it. Flowers of the orchid family are known for their beauty but Kimilsungia, with its pinkish-purple petals and graceful and elegant shape, is extraordinarily beautiful, and evokes ennobling emotions. One cannot but be moved hearing the story about how the flower came to our motherland. Our officials who went to Indonesia to trace the flower found that after the rapid change of situation in that country the director of the Bogor Botanical Garden had worked as a hotel gardener on an outlying island and had done his best to trace the whereabouts of the botanist who had bred Kimilsungia, but failed to find him. On the verge of death, he had made his son promise to find the man by all means, and to convey Kimilsungia to President Kim Il Sung. The director’s son finally did find the botanist, who had preserved the flower and been cultivating it with all sincerity. Thus, Kimilsungia was preserved amidst tribulations of every description, and struck its root in our motherland. 5 Kimilsungia is not simply a beautiful flower of nature; it is a flower that symbolizes the greatness of President Kim Il Sung, who illuminated the road ahead for the world by means of his Juche idea, and a flower that has bloomed in the hearts of the people in the era of independence in honour of a great man. It gives our people an infinite dignity and pride in living and waging revolution in Kim Il Sung’s motherland, and inspires them with determination to devote their all to the consummation of the cause of Juche pioneered by him. Because it grows in the hearts of mankind and blooms among our faithful people, it is so beautiful, so ennobling and so precious. There are tens of thousands of varieties of flowers on the earth, but none is as meaningful as Kimilsungia. After its arrival in our country, I ensured that the flower was sent to the Central Botanical Garden for study of the methods of its cultivation and propagation. It was no easy task to adapt the flower to the climatic and soil conditions of our country, and propagate it. But, convinced that the officials and researchers of the Central Botanical Garden would succeed, I ensured that they were given positive assistance by the Party: A special greenhouse was built; an institute with highly-qualified researchers was organized and the latest equipment and materials necessary for their work were provided; and many seedlings of pure breed were also provided. The researchers, after repeated painstaking study and research under our Party’s deep concern and care, found at long last many methods for propagating in our country the flower that had been bred in a tropical zone. They succeeded in finding the method of propagation by tissue culture, which thus made it possible to produce many seedlings of the flower at one time. The flower was officially registered in a scientific name with an international orchid-related society in Britain in the early 6 1980s, coming to be known as a particularly celebrated flower. Today, Kimilsungia is cultivated in every part of the country–in Pyongyang, in the Mt. Paektu area and on Yonbaek Plain. A modern breeding centre for the flower was set up in the Central Botanical Garden, and more than 300 greenhouses for cultivating it were built in various places of the country. The fact that these modern greenhouses were built in the most difficult days of the “Arduous March” and forced march demonstrates how warmly our soldiers and people revere President Kim Il Sung and how earnestly they miss him. The two plants of Kimilsungia, a flower that was bred in a tropical island country in honour of a great man and that struck its root in our country, have increased to an inestimable number today because of the loyal hearts of our soldiers and people. The Kimilsungia Festival has been held for several years as part of the celebrations of the Day of the Sun. The festival is literally a sea of flowers cultivated by the faithful people in honour of the great man. Flower fairs and flower exhibitions are held all over the world, where various species of rare flowers are displayed, but there is none like the Kimilsungia Festival, in which one species of flower is exhibited presenting a sea of that flower. It is said that 10,000 plants of Kimilsungia are to be exhibited at the forthcoming festival; it is great, indeed. Kimilsungia is a national treasure, and it is a great pride and honour for the Korean people to have an immortal flower named after President Kim Il Sung. We must cultivate this flower well to ensure that it is handed down through generations and it is cultivated in every part of the country. The existing Kimilsungia greenhouses should be kept in a more modern way as required by the new century and they should be maintained with care. The greenhouses should 7 cultivate the flower in a scientific and technological way, and propagate it widely. In order to ensure that the flower is cultivated not only in the greenhouses but also in houses and workplaces, scientific research into the flower should be stepped up. The botanical research sector should make a complete study of the methods and techniques for cultivating the flower on a mass scale, basing itself on the latest achievements of modern bioengineering. We should not limit the cultivation of the flower to specialists, but turn it into a work of the entire country and all the people. We should ensure that cultivating and propagating Kimilsungia is not a process of simply cultivating and propagating a rare flower but a process during which one cherishes loyalty to the Party and the leader, and displays it to the full. Education by means of Kimilsungia is of great significance in enlightening the people in the greatness of President Kim Il Sung. We must give vivid explanations of the greatness of President Kim Il Sung and the meaningful story associated with the immortal flower, so that the Party members, soldiers, and people cherish deeply the pride and self-confidence of being Kim Il Sung’s nation and boundless loyalty to him. The annual Kimilsungia Festival is a political festival which demonstrates to the whole world the faith and will of the Korean nation to honour President Kim Il Sung for ever and exalt his immortal exploits down through all generations. We must organize the festival in a more magnificent and significant way, thus celebrating the Day of the Sun, the greatest national holiday, in a meaningful way. Now the People’s Army is standing in the van not only in cultivating the flower but in participating in the festival. The 8 People’s Army has built Kimilsungia greenhouses, grows the flower with great care and takes part in the festival with all sincerity. This alone shows that the army has established an unshakeable outlook on the leader. The civilians must take their cue from the soldiers. The state administrative guidance organ in charge of Kimilsungia cultivation should set up a correct system of working as required by its duty and function, undertake in a responsible way scientific research into the characteristics of the flower, its propagation and cultivation, technical guidance, and training of specialists. It should also organize the annual festival to suit its characteristics, give wide publicity to it and propagate it abroad. I believe that our officials will cultivate Kimilsungia with success, propagate it widely and conduct education properly by means of the flower.",greet sun since naming kimilsungia traditional

30.04.2006,Kim Jong Il,"We should ensure that our people work steadily to raise their level of knowledge. Knowledge is a powerful weapon in transforming nature and society. As the saying goes, “Knowledge is power,” and one can work more effectively only when one has a wealth of knowledge of nature and society. Knowledge, as well as ideological consciousness, is a prerequisite for the independent and creative activities people conduct to transform nature and society. Knowledge teaches them how to open a blocked road, whereas ignorance blinds them to the open road ahead. This is why it is said that knowledge is light and ignorance is darkness. In creation and construction, knowledge is the greatest wealth and ignorance is the greatest poverty. The need to steadily raise people’s level of knowledge is all the more pressing in the present era of science and technology, the IT era. Science and technology are currently developing at a rapid pace, and the role they are playing in the realms of social progress and social life is bigger than ever before. Every country is focusing on the development of science and technology. Labour in the IT era is being 1 put on a more intelligent and technical footing, and almost all material and cultural wealth is being created by highly-developed science and technology. In the present era of science and technology, the IT era, without raising your knowledge level you cannot do anything as required by the trend of the times or contribute to building a civilized, wealthy society. A wealth of knowledge promotes the development of a country, whereas poverty of knowledge leads to its decline. The fact is that our people’s current level of knowledge is failing to measure up to the demands of the times and of the developing revolution. If they abide by the conventional knowledge and experience at a time when science and technology are developing rapidly, they cannot perform the responsibilities and tasks they have assumed for the times and revolution properly, nor can they make a genuine contribution to society and the collective. Gone are the days when they could work with conventional knowledge and experience. Those, who feel satisfied with their present knowledge or pretend to know what they do not, will fall behind. The level of knowledge of our officials, the leading personnel of the revolution, is also failing to keep pace 2 with the development of science and technology. Some of them are not proactive in mastering advanced technology and are attempting to work with the knowledge they learned many years ago. Their knowledge dates from the 1960s and 70s. It is virtually useless in the practical conditions of today, when science and technology are developing at an unimaginable speed. This being the case, there are few officials who are capable of conducting a scientific analysis of the problems arising in the revolution and construction, in order to solve them. We are faced with the heavy yet honourable task of building a powerful socialist country as soon as possible by vigorously stepping up the general march of the Songun revolution. This is a cause our people must achieve for themselves by dint of modern science and technology. Without modern science and technology, they cannot build a powerful socialist country. They should all learn, learn and learn more so as to possess a high level of knowledge. To raise their level of knowledge, they should study diligently and work with passion. Knowledge is the fruit of diligent study and passionate effort. The most talented people build the tower of knowledge through diligent and passionate study. Knowledge is not 3 something that can be inherited. Just as the son of a revolutionary does not automatically become a revolutionary, so the son of someone with a doctorate does not automatically earn a doctorate. I have heard that an able medical doctor enrolled his son in medical school, but the son’s academic performance was poor as he lacked the attitude of exploring and learning medical science and technology. At a higher level than him are the sons and daughters of ordinary people who study diligently and with passion. The case is similar with the children of the famous creative workers and artistes who are studying at the Pyongyang University of Music and Dance, I have been told. Knowledge can be ceaselessly acquired and enriched only through diligent study and passionate effort. Science and technology, as a wealth shared by humankind, develop and propel social progress from one generation to the next. But they are not passed on from the preceding generations to the coming ones. A low level of knowledge is not something inherited; everyone can have a high level of knowledge if they buckle down to acquiring it with determination. Some officials and ordinary working people who did not graduate from university are presenting inventions and new concepts which are beyond the imagination of scientists and 4 technicians; others are performing with credit the tasks entrusted to them. They are able to do so because they have steadily raised the level of their knowledge by studying hard with a burning passion. Officials and working people should not waste any time, but read books and study diligently in every spare moment so as to master modern science and technology, as well as specialist and general knowledge in various fields. A book is a silent teacher that imparts knowledge and awakens people to the truth. Only by reading a lot of books can one acquire wide-ranging and profound knowledge. However, our people are not reading books. In the past, many people could be seen reading on their way to and from work. But this is no longer the case. Everyone should have a book in their hand not only on their way to and from work, but also during breaks from labour or on their days off. In this way, they can make the most of their time by reading books. They should make reading part of their daily life and habit. They should study substantially and persistently. If they study in the same way as they lick the surface of a watermelon, what they learn is worthless, and they will have wasted their time. In whatever they are learning, they should delve into it and gain a clear 5 understanding of its essence. Thus they should strive continually to acquire knowledge that is helpful in their practical work. In creating a revolutionary climate of studying, officials, as the leading personnel of the revolution, should set an example and make exacting demands on others. This is the only way to establish such a climate throughout society. Studying is the primary duty of revolutionaries. If they are negligent in studying, they cannot perform their revolutionary tasks properly or work at their posts. They should all study diligently to raise their level of knowledge and their abilities. Party and working people’s organizations should pay close attention to ensuring that a revolutionary climate of studying permeates society. They should make exacting demands so that no one can avoid studying, and they should discover a correct methodology for creating a revolutionary climate of studying. We need to pay close attention to educational work. The conditions in our country for everyone to study are sufficient. There are many universities and colleges in the capital city and regions, and well-knit systems for studying-while-you-work and continuous education have been established. The point is to 6 improve the quality of education. We should raise the quality of education in line with the demands of the new era, the IT era. Only then can we bring up talented individuals capable of shouldering the building of a powerful socialist country. In improving the quality of education, raising teachers’ qualifications is vital. Their qualifications decide the quality of education. Whether students’ level of knowledge is high or not depends largely on their teachers’ qualifications. With a high sense of dignity and pride in being career revolutionaries responsible for bringing up talented personnel for the country, teachers should study passionately so as steadily to improve their qualifications. Teaching methods also need to be improved. In education, efforts should be directed to cultivating students’ creative application while teaching them the knowledge they need. Cultivating such abilities is a global trend in the development of education. At present, a significant number of university graduates are failing to display their creative abilities as they should in their work. This is related to our teaching methods. Educational institutions should decisively improve their teaching methods so as to nurture talented personnel who have mastered modern science 7 and technology and are capable of performing their assignments effectively. The work of raising people’s level of knowledge should be conducted in close combination with practical activities. Practice is the starting point of understanding things and phenomena, and an engine for the development of theory. Through practical activities, people enrich their knowledge and make it pragmatic. By nature, knowledge serves practical activities, and only knowledge combined with practice is useful. Knowledge for its own sake, knowledge that cannot be applied in practice, is useless. Our efforts to raise the level of knowledge across society are aimed not at making them bookworms, but at training them as pillars who have knowledge that can be applied in practice in the revolution and construction. Officials and working people should, by taking part in practical activities and consolidating the knowledge they have learned, raise its level so as to contribute to the revolution and construction. We should ignite the flame of steadily improving the level of knowledge across society and thus ensure that, through the application of modern science and technology, all our officials and working people add lustre to their Juche-oriented socialist country",ensure steadily raise level knowledge knowledge weapon transform nature society saying go knowledge power effectively wealth knowledge

17.10.2006,Kim Jong Il,"Eighty years have passed since the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung formed the Down-withImperialism Union. In his early years on the road of revolutionary struggle, the great leader shouldered the responsibility for the destiny of the country and nation. The nationalist and early communist movements that had come before had been beset by hegemonic infighting, factional strife, the worship of big powers and dogmatism. This led him to the keen realization that this was not the way to liberate the country and regain its independence. So, he dedicated himself to searching for a completely new path, a fresh course of struggle. This endeavour eventually resulted in the Down-with-Imperialism Union, which he formed on October 17, 1926 with other hot-blooded young men of the new generation, who shared his ideology and aim. Today is a significant occasion, when we are marking the 80th anniversary of the DIU. The formation of this union was a historic event that declared a fresh start to the Korean revolution. It was also an epochal turning point in shaping the destiny of our people. It put the Korean revolution on the 1 trajectory of independent development, based on clear objectives and strategy, and enabled our people, as the motive force of history, to carve out their destiny on their own responsibility and by their own efforts. Down-with-Imperialism Union–the name alone gives us a clear idea of our leader’s greatness. By declaring, as a teenager, an all-out war against world imperialism, he proved himself to be the greatest of the great. The DIU is the roots of our Party, the origin of Songun, a paradigm of unity and a banner of victory for our revolution. By building on the traditions of the DIU, our Party has developed into a revolutionary party of a Juche type–seasoned, sophisticated and ever-victorious–and our army into an invincible force. Our Party, army and people have now achieved rocksolid, single-hearted unity around the leader and are propelling our revolution along the road of victory without suffering a single failure or setback. In greeting the DIU’s significant 80th anniversary, I am renewing my resolve to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche, which the leader pioneered and advanced along the road of victory. Our revolution, which started with the formation of the DIU, has travelled a long road and has a still longer 2 road ahead of it. In following this road, we may encounter a mountain of ordeals and face do-or-die battles. No matter how harsh the ordeals and difficulties may be, we should, without fail, carry forward the traditions of the DIU and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche that was pioneered by the leader. These traditions are the lifeblood of our revolution and its enduring cornerstone. Our Party has grown from the stout roots of the DIU, and we should, above all else, build it up and enhance its leadership role. The Workers’ Party of Korea is the General Staff of our revolution; it organizes and guides our people in all their victories. It is only by strengthening it and enhancing its leadership role to meet the demands of the developing times and revolution that our Party can fully discharge its mission and tasks. A fundamental guarantee for strengthening the Party and enhancing its leadership role is to establish a system of unified leadership firmly within it. The Party’s unified leadership system is the one based on the leader and his ideology. By firmly establishing this system, we can ensure that the leader’s ideology holds undivided sway throughout the Party and establish revolutionary discipline and order whereby 3 the entire Party moves as one under his leadership. We must never tolerate any heterogeneous ideas and factional actions that run counter to the leader’s ideology. Rather, we should solidify in every way possible the unity and cohesion of the Party based on the leader’s ideology. Cadres form the hard core and backbone of the Party. The strengthening and development of the Party, as well as its leadership role, hinge on the quality of cadre ranks. If we carry out effective personnel administration, the selection of cadres in particular, we can make sure that these ranks are made up of those who are faithful to the Party and competent and have a good work style. In addition, if we strictly observe Party principles in increasing its membership, we can ensure the purity of the Party’s ranks and improve the quality of its membership. The broad sections of the population are the mass foundation of our Party. A party devoid of a mass base cannot survive; only when it strikes deep root among the masses of the people and enjoys their support and trust can it become strong and fully realize its leadership over the revolution and construction. The Party’s mass foundation should be steadily solidified, and to this end it is necessary to work effectively with 4 the masses as required by the developing reality and rally a wide spectrum of the population firmly around the Party. The main stress in working with the masses should, above all else, be focused on current records; no matter how chequered a person’s socio-political background may be, we should not call it into question if their current records are good enough. A party is an organic whole of its various organizations, and its leadership is realized through them. Its might is an indication of their fighting effectiveness, and its leadership ability is a reflection of their guiding ability. We should build up the Party’s organizations and enhance their functions and role in every possible way. We should form Party organizations properly, build up Party leadership bodies at all levels and ensure that the higher Party organizations strengthen their control and guidance over the lower ones. We should continue, under the uplifted banner of Songun, to direct a major effort to increasing the country’s defence capabilities. The defence capabilities of a country and nation are synonymous with its sovereignty and its right to existence, and on these hinge its destiny and dignity. A nation whose defence capabilities are not sufficiently 5 strong will have no voice, will tend to truckle to others, and ultimately will become subordinate to them and suffer the fate of enslavement. Thanks to our strong defence capabilities, we can stand up to the world’s sole superpower, which is what the US imperialists claim to be, and can exalt the dignity of our country and nation. Our recent successful nuclear test has demonstrated the reality of our country’s possession of nuclear weapon and elevated it to the status of a nuclear weapons state. Songun Korea today has incomparable might. However difficult our domestic situation may be, we should spare nothing to strengthen its defence capabilities, its war deterrent. The People’s Army makes up the major component of our defence capabilities. It is an armed force formed of soldiers prepared to fight the enemy face to face with arms. Strengthening the army politically, ideologically, militarily and technologically is precisely the way for us to safeguard socialism and guarantee our people a happy life. We should establish the unified command system of the Supreme Commander within the People’s Army so as to make it the army of the Party and of the Supreme Commander, which moves as one on his orders. The People’s Army, true to the Party’s training-first policy, should 6 intensify combat and political training so as to prepare all the service personnel as a-match-for-a-hundred combatants of the Songun era who will defy death and defeat any enemy, however formidable, at a stroke. Army-people unity is the source of the People’s Army’s invincibility. Because the army helps the people and the people aid the army, together they can achieve unity of ideology and fighting spirit, and in times of emergency, can commit themselves with a single mind and purpose to the sacred cause of annihilating the enemy. We should continue to direct primary attention to developing our defence industry. The defence industry constitutes the material basis of military power. Our defence industry has attained a very high level under the leadership of the Party. We should not rest on our laurels, but make sustained efforts to develop it. Then we can produce larger quantities of new and powerful weapons and combat equipment that are suited to the requirements of modern warfare to steadily improve the weaponry of the People’s Army. Our Party consistently pursues the line of prioritizing military affairs. We should create a climate of prioritizing military affairs nationwide so that the entire Party, the whole country and all the people work 7 hard to master military affairs and are fully prepared to cope with any emergency, and the whole country is turned into an impregnable fortress. We should consolidate the single-hearted unity of the Party, army and people by carrying forward the tradition of unity created by the DIU. Single-hearted unity is the most powerful weapon and the great foundation of our revolution. A revolution is pioneered, advances and is being carried to victory on the strength of unity. No weapon is more powerful than unity in a revolutionary struggle and nobody on this planet can overpower a united force. United, one becomes strong, but divided, one grows weak. By consolidating the single-hearted unity of the Party, army and people, we can carry our revolution to victory on the strength of unity. The headquarters of the revolution is the centre of unity and leadership. Unity without a centre is not genuine unity. The vanguard fighters of the DIU held up the great leader as their centre of unity and, rallied firmly around him, blazed the trail for the Korean revolution. Just as those vanguard fighters did, so the entire Party, the whole army and all the people should imbue themselves with the staunch spirit of defending the leader to the death, safeguarding the headquarters 8 of the revolution in any adversity, and achieve rocksolid unity behind it in ideology, purpose and moral obligation. They should travel the road of revolution, come rain or shine, sharing the same ideology, purpose and destiny with the leader, and trusting and following him and nobody else as his true comrades and comrades-in-arms. Our Party’s politics are benevolent, based on love and trust. People who are loved and trusted follow one another and band together, whereas those who are doubted and marginalized fall by the wayside and split up. We should apply the Party’s benevolent politics to the letter and embrace all those who entrust their destiny to the Party and follow it, and rally them around it without questioning their past. We must be ever-vigilant against the enemy’s attempts to undermine our single-hearted unity. Having failed in their attempts to suffocate us by force, the enemy is clinging to a despicable psychological smear campaign and spreading corrupt capitalist ideology and culture with an aim to undermine us from within. We should keep a sharp eye on the enemy’s manoeuvrings and boost ideological education and struggle in order to prevent any element of capitalist ideology and culture, 9 however insignificant, from infiltrating us. Under the leadership of the Party, we should step up the building of a powerful socialist country on the strength of Songun and single-hearted unity. Building a powerful socialist country was the great leader’s wish, and it is the fighting goal set by our Party. We should ensure that all our service personnel and other people, mindful of the great national pride and selfrespect they feel for living and conducting the revolution in the Songun era, turn out with one accord in the efforts to build a powerful country. A key task currently facing us in building a powerful socialist country is to concentrate on economic construction with a view to revitalizing the country’s economy as soon as possible and developing it as required by the new century. The economy is the material basis of social life. By concentrating on economic construction to boost the economy, we can consolidate our country’s status as an ideological and military power and improve the people’s living standards, thus demonstrating the advantages of socialism. We can now say that our country has definitely attained the status of a powerful country politically, ideologically and militarily, but this is not the case in economic terms. It is only by 10 also achieving economic prosperity that we can proudly call ours a powerful socialist country. We should step up economic construction at all costs so as to develop our country into an economic giant. Drastic measures are needed to improve the people’s standard of living. Our people have been forced to tighten their belts owing to the US imperialists’ moves of aggression and their isolateand-stifle schemes against our Republic. From now on, we should prioritize economic construction so that the people enjoy the benefits. Some officials take it for granted that the people will experience difficulties under the present circumstances, claiming that it is a natural requirement of Songun. They are misguided. The intended purpose of Songun is to make our people well off. We should decisively resolve the food problem by carrying out the Party’s policy of the agricultural revolution, and raise the fierce flames of a revolution in light industry to produce large quantities of consumer goods. Then we can ensure that our people live happily and have no cause to envy others. We should, as soon as possible, shore up such vanguard sectors of the national economy as electric power, coal-mining and the metallurgical industries. When these sectors are leading from the vanguard, the 11 national economy overall will pick up and flourish. We should channel our efforts into developing these sectors so as to normalize their production at a high level. In particular, the problem of electricity and coal needs to be resolved. The strain on the coal supply has caused electricity output to stagnate, and that which is still being generated is poor in quality. Undisciplined practices remain prevalent in the supply and consumption of electric power. Several factors are causing the electric power and coal-mining industries to operate inefficiently, the major one being the lack of fully committed officials in charge of them. In recent years, there has been a lack of effective control and guidance over them. Leading officials in these industries should be awakened and adopt radical measures to resolve the pressing problem of electricity faced by the country. In addition to taking steps to increase its output, we should correct the undisciplined practices in the supply and consumption of electricity. Recently, the national combined headquarters for adopting measures to resolve the problem of electric power has been reestablished to provide more effective supervision and control over the generation, supply and consumption of electric power. The members of this headquarters 12 should enhance their sense of responsibility and role and, in the coming months, improve the methods for correcting the undisciplined practices so as to meet the demands of the new century. The construction sector should consistently implement the Party’s policy of building structures that are perfect in their formative and aesthetic beauty. At every opportunity I have stressed the need to avoid simplicity in building styles and ensure the perfection of structures in their formative and aesthetic beauty. Recently, in order to guarantee the formative and aesthetic beauty of major renovation projects, I had domestically-produced materials used in the main in addition to a few kinds of imported materials. And for a construction project, I had domestically-produced materials used to decorate the edges and lower parts of the walls, and to add the finishing touches to the patterns and sculptures. The results were impeccable. This shows that domestically-produced materials can be used in adding the finishing touches that ensure the formative and aesthetic beauty of structures. For the sake of the formative and aesthetic beauty of structures, the construction sector should encourage the use of domestically-produced materials rather than depend on imported ones. 13 Structures should be designed well. Designing the doors can be said to be one of the biggest challenges facing our architects. Poorly designed doors mar the characteristic features of a structure. The construction sector should pay attention to creating door designs of various forms and styles that suit the characteristics and purposes of structures and to ensuring high quality in their production. Buildings must not be constructed without permission. There are still some instances of organs and enterprises erecting buildings without obtaining the approval of the state. This is due to the slackening of state supervision and control over construction projects. Construction supervision organs must tighten their supervision and control so as to prevent other organs and enterprises from undertaking unauthorized construction. All organs and enterprises should be allowed to build structures after obtaining state approval, and design them well so that they can remain perfect long into the future. Economic officials should give full play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. Other countries are not willing to help us, and we have no one to turn to for assistance. This is the time when we should hold the slogan of self-reliance higher than 14 ever before. Only by adhering to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and relying on our own efforts and technology, can we find solutions to the food and all other economic problems. Officials, by prioritizing the interests of the state, should direct close attention to managing the country’s economy and valuing and protecting its resources. After earning foreign currency, some officials are spending it for the benefit of their own units instead of transferring it to the state’s coffers. Such malpractice should be rectified. In a family, the children should give their parents any money they have earned so that it can be used to the maximum benefit. A family is doomed if each member spends their individual income for their own benefit. Likewise, national organs and enterprises should transfer all their income to the state for it to use effectively for the prosperity of the country, the people’s living and state administration. The random use by any organ or enterprise of the foreign currency it has earned must not be permitted. All the foreign currency earned by organs and enterprises should be transferred to the state’s coffers for the sake of economic construction, defence building and state administration. Organs and enterprises may use part of their foreign currency income, but should always 15 obtain the state’s approval first. Natural resources are the country’s priceless treasure and a valuable asset for the prosperity of the country and the wellbeing of the coming generations. The great leader never approved any plan for exporting these resources indiscriminately. On one occasion a plan was submitted to him for making wooden chopsticks and selling them abroad. He rejected it, saying that trees must be protected and making wooden chopsticks to earn foreign currency was not worth it. I have several times pointed to the necessity of prohibiting the random export of our country’s resources. Even those countries with a large land area and rich resources are reluctant to sell their resources to other countries. However, our officials attempt to export the country’s resources instead of protecting them. The continued export of these resources will lead to their depletion and ultimately to the deterioration of the land. Exporting the country’s resources in their natural state is tantamount to treachery. Officials should not, out of an obsession with making money, consider selling the country’s resources, but treasure them and strive to protect them",eighty year pass since leader sung form down

05.09.2008,Kim Jong Il,"In this historic period, when we are entering a golden age of national prosperity under the Songun-based revolutionary leadership of the Workers’ Party of Korea, we will be greeting the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the glorious country of Kim Il Sung. The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung was the founder of the DPRK and the father of socialist Korea, and he is the eternal President of State. The founding of the Republic under his leadership brought about a fundamental change in the shaping of the destiny of our country and its people. Guided by his Juche-oriented philosophy on State building, and under his seasoned and sophisticated leadership, our Republic has been established and developed as a genuine country of the people, as a Juche-oriented socialist country, the first of its kind in history, and our people, who were oppressed and maltreated for centuries, have become able to enjoy, in the embrace of the Republic, the pride and happiness of a genuine life in which they exercise full rights as masters of the State and society. The mountains and rivers, which are getting more and more beautiful with each passing day, the vast expanses of farmland, the urban and rural areas, the streets and villages, the defence lines and frontline posts that have been built up to be impregnable, and the many factories, enterprises, economic and cultural establishments and monumental structures, all bear the imprints of President Kim Il Sung’s great and sacred leadership; and every aspect of the most dignified, prestigious and fulfilling life that our people are enjoying generation after generation, century after century, is associated with his benevolent, fatherly affection and solicitude. As we greet the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Republic, our Party members, service personnel and people 1 solemnly look back upon the great revolutionary career and immortal revolutionary exploits of President Kim Il Sung, who devoted his whole life to the country and the people, and bestow on him the highest gratitude and glory. The immortal exploits he achieved for the country and the people constitute the eternal cornerstone of our country and revolution and an unshakable foundation on which to build a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country and carry forward and accomplish the Juche revolutionary cause. By holding President Kim Il Sung in high esteem as the Sun of Juche, and developing his philosophy on and exploits in State building, our Party is opening up the road of building a thriving country in the Songun era, the road of fresh victory for our revolution. Thanks to our Party’s leadership and advance in the Songun-based revolution, our Republic has risen as a Juche-oriented socialist State with invincible political and military might, demonstrating its prestige and dignity. Our Party members, service personnel and people are now firmly determined to glorify, in answer to the Party’s call, this meaningful year as a year of historic change that will be recorded in the history of the country and to accomplish, under the banner of Songun, the successful building of both a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country and the Juche revolutionary cause. 1 The 60-year history of our Republic is a history of great struggle and victory, a history of great creation and transformation, in which, braving the tempest of the revolution under the leadership of the great leader and the great Party, the independence 2 and honour of the country were defended and a thriving socialist country was built. Our Republic, in the whole period of its history from the first days when the foundations for State building were laid up to the present, when we are building it up into a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country, has followed a road covered with victory and glory, braving unprecedented difficulties and trials amid a sharp confrontation with the imperialist forces of aggression. Our struggle to build a new country, a new society, has been grim and arduous, as we have had to overcome every manner of hardship. However, our country blazed a trail in accomplishing the cause of antiimperialist independence, the cause of socialism, and created historic miracles in this course, thus accumulating great and imperishable exploits and valuable experiences. This is why the 60-year history of our Republic has come to shine with such brilliance and our socialist country, Songun Korea, to demonstrate such prestige and dignity today as the citadel of independence, the bulwark of socialism. The anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle the great leader organized and led was a historic struggle that laid the basis for the founding of our Republic and ushered in the era of socialist State building. It was a sacred, patriotic struggle to defeat the Japanese imperialist aggressors, who had occupied our country by force of arms, and liberate the country, and the fiercest of revolutionary wars fought against the heavily-armed Japanese imperialist aggressor forces. The great leader led the 20-year bloody struggle against Japanese imperialism and crowned the anti-Japanese war with victory, thus accomplishing the historic cause of national liberation. In the flames of the anti-Japanese revolutionary 3 struggle he put forward the policy of building a people’s government, accumulated valuable experience in this regard and created our glorious revolutionary traditions, which are the eternal wealth of the country and the revolution. The struggle of our Party and people to build an independent and sovereign State on the land of our liberated country was conducted in very complicated and difficult circumstances and conditions. Owing to the US imperialists’ occupation of south Korea, the country’s territory was divided into two, and the imperialist and reactionary forces at home and abroad resorted to every manner of vicious scheme to thwart our Party and people in their efforts to build a new country. President Kim Il Sung established the people’s power and regular revolutionary armed forces that inherited the traditions of the anti-Japanese revolution and, by enlisting the high patriotic enthusiasm of the liberated people and all other patriotic forces, laid solid foundations for the building of an independent and sovereign State through democratic reforms in the northern half of Korea, thus frustrating the schemes of the imperialist and reactionary forces. On this basis, he founded our Republic. He wisely led the work of strengthening the power organs, developing the people-oriented State and social system of the Republic and bringing its advantages and vitality into full play in all areas of State building. The Fatherland Liberation War against the armed invasion of the US imperialists was the first and grimmest trial faced by our young Republic; it was a fierce war that would decide the fate of the country and nation. The US imperialists made desperate efforts to crush our Republic in its cradle, hurling into the war a huge force of their own aggressor army and of their 15 vassal States, as well as the latest military hardware and other means of waging war, only to suffer ignominious defeat. Under the leadership of President Kim Il Sung, the ever- 4 victorious and iron-willed, brilliant commander, our soldiers and people turned out as one in the just Fatherland Liberation War and fought in a self-sacrificing manner, giving a full demonstration of their unparalled mass heroism at the front and in the rear. Consequently, they defeated the US aggressor armed forces that had been boasting of being the “mightiest” in the world, defended the freedom and independence of their country with honour, encouraged the oppressed peoples of the world in their anti-imperialist national liberation struggle, and made a great contribution to safeguarding world peace. The historic victory of our Republic in the Fatherland Liberation War was clear testimony to its invincible might, to the strength of our State and social system, to the confidence of our army and people in sure victory, and to their indefatigable fighting spirit. It also demonstrated that no force can conquer a people who have taken their destiny in their own hands and are united solidly behind their party and leader. For its victory in the war, in which it shattered the myth of the US imperialists being the “strongest” and inflicted a crushing defeat on them for the first time in the world history of war, our Republic won a worldwide reputation as a heroic country, its army as a heroic army and its people as a heroic people. Not only did our Korea, the land of Juche, emerge victorious from the military confrontation with the formidable imperialist aggressor forces, but it also worked miracles and made innovations in the ensuing postwar reconstruction, socialist revolution and socialist construction. Starting from scratch on the war debris, we achieved epoch-making development in the revolution and construction. Under the seasoned leadership of President Kim Il Sung, our country completed its postwar reconstruction in a matter of just a few years and carried out the cooperative reorganization 5 of the rural economy and the socialist transformation of private trade and industry perfectly in the Korean style and without any deviation. In response to the call of the leader, our people embarked on the grand Chollima march in the spirit of taking ten or a hundred steps when others were taking one, thus effecting a great revolutionary upsurge that was unprecedented in socialist construction. Through the gigantic struggle to create and construct socialism, our country, having been backward for centuries, emerged as a most advantageous and powerful people-centred socialist country, a socialist power, that is independent in politics, self-supporting in the economy and self-reliant in defence, a country called Chollima Korea, a model for socialist countries throughout the world. The Songun era, a new era in the Juche revolution, occupies a special position in the history of our country and revolution. It is a great era of the Juche revolutionary cause in which the ideas, leadership and cause of President Kim Il Sung are inherited and carried forward, and it constitutes a new, higher stage in the development of our country and revolution. Long ago our Party put forward modelling the whole society on the Juche idea as its ultimate programme, and it has held fast to it as the basic line in building the Party, the State and the army, true to the noble idea of President Kim Il Sung. It concentrated all its efforts on building and developing the Party, the State and the army as the Party of the leader, as the State of the leader, and as the army of the leader, and on remoulding man and transforming society and nature as required by the leader’s revolutionary idea, the Juche idea, thus laying strong foundations for carrying out the cause of modelling the whole society on the Juche idea. In the 1990s the situation took a sudden turn, and grim trials and hardship, the rigours of which were unprecedented 6 in history, were laid in the way of our country and revolution. Taking advantage of the collapse of socialism in several countries, the imperialists and reactionaries clamoured about the “end of socialism,” directing the spearhead of their attack against our Republic, which was holding high as ever the banner of socialism. Their antiDPRK, anti-socialist manoeuvres put the sovereignty and right to existence of our country and nation at jeopardy; our country was turned into a theatre of the fiercest confrontation between socialism and imperialism and our people found themselves at a crossroads, where remaining as an independent people lay in one direction and becoming colonial slaves once again in the other. To cope with the prevailing situation, our Party raised high the banner of Songun, under which it frustrated every scheme of the imperialists and reactionaries against the DPRK and socialism by dint of our invincible political and military might, thus safeguarding the sovereignty of the country and nation and our style of socialism with honour. It is a great victory of international significance for our small country to have defended itself, its nation and its socialism in single-handed confrontation with the US-led imperialist reactionaries. Our country has, without firing a shot, registered one victory after another in its political and military confrontation with the US imperialists, facing down and smashing the aggressive moves of an enemy that had been behaving in a high-handed and arbitrary manner in every part of the world. These achievements of our Songun-based revolution are literally a miracle. In spite of the grim trials we have faced in the struggle to defend socialism, we have achieved tremendous development in all spheres of politics, the military, the economy and culture. 7 Thanks to the Party’s Songun-based revolutionary leadership, our country has occupied the position of a politico-ideological and military power, paved the way for building a great, prosperous and powerful nation and brought about a fresh turn in the revolution and construction. Our Republic has now secured a fundamental guarantee for building a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country and accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche, and it is stepping up the general march of the Songun revolution for building the country into a socialist economic power. Socialist Korea, which is winning victories and displaying its might by dint of Songun, has become a beacon of hope and a banner of victory for the people of the world who aspire to independence. The 60-year history travelled by the Republic under the leadership of President Kim Il Sung and our Party, instills in our people the deepest pride and self-confidence and hardens their faith in sure victory. Our army and people prize their Juche-oriented socialist country more than their own lives, love it infinitely and are working more vigorously to defend and add lustre to it, their motherland. 2 A great leader and a great party build a great nation. If a leader and a party are great, their country, even though it may be small and once backward, can become a developed and dignified, powerful one. The greatness of a leader and a party is precisely the greatness of their ideology and leadership. Our Republic has been able to rise as a Juche-oriented socialist State with 8 invincible might because it is guided by the Juche idea that was authored by the great leader and because it embodies this idea fully in State building and State activities under the leadership of our Party. The immortal Juche idea is a man-centred outlook on the world, and an ideology of independence; it is a great guiding ideology of our era that sheds scientific light on the way of championing and realizing the independence of the masses and of the country and nation. Our Republic, which incorporates the great Juche idea in its State building and State activities, is a people-centred socialist country in which the people are regarded as God, an independent socialist State with a strong Juche character and national identity, and an invincible socialist power that prevails over any enemy, however formidable, and overcomes every manner of trial and hardship by dint of Songun. Our Republic is a genuine people’s country, a peoplecentred socialist State that upholds the masses of the people as the masters of the State and society, and serves them. Although the masses of the people are the driving force of social history, it is not true to say that their position and role are always identical in any society or country. Never before in history has there been a country like our Republic that guarantees the position and role of the masses at the highest level by embodying the doctrine “The people are my God,” which was President Kim Il Sung’s dictum. This philosophy is permeated with the noble love for the people that is expressed in upholding the masses of the people as the most valuable and powerful beings in the world, serving them faithfully and solving everything by relying on them. The dictum “The people are my God” is our Party’s fundamental principle in State building and the basis of all its 9 lines and policies, as well as the starting point of the activities of the State. Everything in our Republic–the socialist system of the State and society, the Socialist Constitution and other State laws, as well as all the lines, policies and activities of the Party and the State–is geared to defending and ensuring the independent rights and interests of the masses. The basis of socialism is the people. Our politics, which regards the interests of the people as the foremost concern, is genuine socialist politics and the politics of infinite love for and trust in the people, that is, noble, benevolent politics. Every line and policy of our Party and the government of our Republic reflects the opinions and demands of the masses and is successfully implemented by their voluntary zeal and struggle. In our country, promoting the people’s well-being is regarded as the supreme principle in the activities of the Party and the State, the slogan “We serve the people!” is fully incorporated in State activities, and the infringement of the people’s interests and lording it over them by the abuse of authority and bureaucratic behaviour are never tolerated. Since the masses of the people are regarded as the most valuable beings, the State, the army, the public security organ, many monumental edifices and various honorary titles are named after “people,” and this is a powerful symbol of the people-oriented character of our State, our system and our politics. Our people, who hold the position of masters of the State and society in the embrace of the people-centred socialist country, are enjoying a worthwhile and fulfilling life and performing their responsibilities and roles as such. Each of them takes part in the exercise of State power and State administration with equal rights and leads a valuable political life in a particular political organization. The State bears responsibility for the people’s livelihood; all the people study 10 to their hearts’ content, promote their health and enjoy a revolutionary cultural and recreational life that is full of optimism thanks to the systems of free education and medical care and various other people-oriented policies. Now our Party and State, despite the strained conditions in which everything is in short supply, are concentrating all their efforts on stabilizing and improving the people’s livelihood, with their primary attention focused on it, and stepping up the building of an economically powerful socialist country so as to ensure in the near future that our people live a rich life with no reason for envying anyone in the world. The independent and creative life our people are enjoying in the embrace of the Republic is a genuine human life, dignified, worthwhile and happy, which is something unimaginable in a capitalist society. Our Party and our Republic are the most affectionate motherly party and motherly country that lead the people and take care of them with love and trust, and their embrace constitutes the cradle of the genuine life and happiness of the people. For this reason, our people have sacrificed themselves in the defence of their country, their motherland, and, firmly united behind the Party, waged a heroic struggle for its prosperity, invariably trusting and following our Party and the government of the Republic both in days of glory and in days of grim trials. The single-hearted unity of the whole society constitutes a priceless achievement in State building that could only be made by our socialist country under the leadership of President Kim Il Sung, who was endowed with love for and trust in the people, and of our Party, which faithfully carries forward his ideas and will. This is the proud face of our society, the like of which cannot be witnessed elsewhere in the world. Based on the relations of revolutionary comradeship, and the 11 inseparable blood ties by which the Party and the leader boundlessly love and care for the people and the latter absolutely trust and loyally support the former, the singlehearted unity of the leader, the Party and the masses was formed and has developed despite the complicated and difficult circumstances and conditions, and the whole society has become a great harmonious family in which its members help and lead one another forward. Today our single-hearted unity has been further strengthened at a new height of unity in which the entire Party, the whole army and all the people are joined together rock-solid, centred on the revolutionary leadership and based on one ideology and faith, comradely love and revolutionary obligation. No force can break this great unity. Our single-hearted unity is the fundamental guarantee of the strength of the socialist system and social stability in our country, the inexhaustible source of the invincible might of our socialist motherland and the powerful driving force of the victorious advance of the revolution and the building of a thriving nation. The US imperialists are most fearful of the singlehearted unity of our entire army and the people behind the great Party, and resort to every conceivable scheme to break it. While persisting with their aggressive military manoeuvres, the US imperialists and their acolytes try to slander us under the signboard of “human rights” and “democracy,” but this is wild dream. The “defence of human rights” and “democracy” the imperialist reactionaries advocate are nothing other than sophistry to hide their intervention in and hegemonic moves towards other countries. It is preposterous to slander our Republic, which is the motherland of the people, and our society that is united single-heartedly, with such far-fetched sophistry. It 12 only serves to trigger the unanimous indignation of our people, and can never be tolerated. This country of the great people, this people-centred socialism of our own style, which enjoys the absolute support and trust and ardent love of the masses, will forever add brilliance to its noble image and dignity, overcoming every manner of trial. Our Republic is an independent socialist State that absolutely maintains its Juche character and thoroughly preserves its national identity in its development and activities. The Juche character and national identity are the independence and lifeline of a country, a nation and the masses of the people. The struggle of the masses for independence is waged with the country and nation as the unit, so the party, the government and the masses of each country should conduct the revolution and construction independently and creatively as masters. It is only when they hold fast to the Juche character and national identity and maintain the line of independence in the revolution and construction that they can defend the sovereignty of the country and nation, guarantee their independent development and realize the independence of the masses successfully. Having put forward such original ideas on the Juche character, the national identity and the line of independence for the first time in history, President Kim Il Sung blazed the trail for the independent development of the Korean revolution and guaranteed, by dint of his iron faith and will and seasoned leadership, that the principle of Juche, the line of independence, was maintained consistently in the revolution and construction. True to his idea of State building, our Party and State regarded preserving the Juche character, the national identity and the line of independence as the fundamental 13 principle in accomplishing the cause of the masses’ independence, the cause of socialism, and strictly adhered to it, and thus built our country into a highly dignified and prestigious independent country, a socialist State embodying noble love for the people and nation. We have solved all the problems arising in the building and activities of the State and in the revolution and construction by our own efforts and in our own way on the principle of selfreliance, in accordance with our ideology and faith, our determination and will and the actual situation in our country, and in line with the interests of our revolution. By holding fast to the principle of Juche, the principle of independence, in all fields of politics, the economy, military affairs, culture and external relations, we have resolutely opposed great-power worship, dogmatism and all other ideas advocating dependence on outside forces, and categorically rejected any form of intervention and pressure by the imperialist reactionaries and other foreign forces. We are also doing everything we choose and decide in conformity with our own ideology, demands and interests, regardless of the existing theories or formulas, and despite what others may say. Our Party long ago put forward the slogan of “Let us live our own way!”; this is Juche, independence and selfreliance, and herein lie our dignity, pride and honour. President Kim Il Sung, based on the Juche stand, shed a fresh, scientific light on the essence of the issue of the nation and its position and role in social development and, on the basis of this, linked class character with national identity, and the destiny of socialism with that of the nation; thus he made it possible to preserve the national character in the revolution and construction while maintaining the class character and to open up a vista for achieving the prosperity of the nation while advancing the socialist cause. 14 Our Party and State treasure and preserve the nation’s identity in the revolution and construction and in all fields of social life in line with President Kim Il Sung’s Juche-oriented idea and theory on the issue of the nation. Since a man is a member of a class and at the same time a member of a nation, he embodies a national identity along with a class character and entertains national demands along with class demands. If the national identity and national demands are neglected and suppressed, it will be impossible to rally the broad sections of the masses and other patriotic forces, build a truly independent and sovereign State, or successfully carry out the cause of the masses’ independence, the cause of socialism. Ours is a proud nation with a time-honoured history of 5 000 years and a brilliant culture. Reflected in our people’s national identity are their nation’s resourcefulness, talents, firm character, patriotic spirit and outstanding cultural traditions. Our Party and State have made valuing and preserving the excellent and beautiful traditions of our nation a major policy, and have fully implemented it. While preserving the excellent features of our nation that have been handed down throughout its history, we are creating new excellent features of the nation along with the advance of the times and the revolution; on the basis of this, we are educating the people in the Korean-nationfirst spirit, the spirit that our leader, our Party, our ideology and our system are the best, and adding brilliance to the greatness of our nation. The socialist cause of Juche is a cause for realizing the independence of the working class and other working masses and at the same time a cause for guaranteeing the independence of the country and nation and achieving the nation’s prosperity. Our Party and State have, while stepping up socialist construction, enriched the excellent qualities of the nation and 15 added a new chapter of national prosperity to history. Because we properly maintained the Juche character and preserved the national identity of the revolution and construction under the leadership of the great leader and the great Party, no form of intervention or pressure from the imperialist reactionaries could cut any ice with us, no modern revisionism or other ideological trend towards opportunism could make inroads into our country, and our people have been able to cherish a uniquely high level of national pride, selfconfidence, consciousness of national independence and selfrespect, and give fuller play to the spirit of socialist patriotism. Our Republic, which has developed under the banner of the Juche idea, is demonstrating its pride in being a people-centred socialist country that fully embodies class and revolutionary principles, and at the same time, a socialist State, independent, self-supporting and self-reliant in defence, strong in the Juche character and national identity, and the genuine motherland of the whole nation. Our Juche-oriented socialist motherland has stood firm amid the worldwide great political cataclysms, and will win victory after victory by following the road of development, the road of Juche, as ever. The imperialist reactionaries are now slandering our Republic, the motherland of Juche, claiming that it is “closed” and “isolated,” and are making futile attempts to lead us to “reform” and “openness.” Our country has never closed its doors, and it maintains good relations with many countries, home to billions of people, around the world, based on mutual respect. As for reform, we reformed the outdated social system in a revolutionary fashion decades ago, and have been constantly creating the new and renovating what is old and backward. In actual fact, the imperialists and reactionaries are hostile towards our country and are blockading it and trying to 16 isolate it. The “reform” and “openness” they are advocating represent a move to destroy and put down our style of socialism. Such moves will only worsen their relations with us and are doomed to failure. Our Republic is an invincible socialist power that demonstrates its dignity by dint of Songun. The history of the revolutionary activities of President Kim Il Sung and our Party is the history of Songun-based revolutionary leadership, and our country and revolution have travelled a road covered with victory and glory by displaying their invincible might under the banner of Songun. President Kim Il Sung liberated the country by dint of Songun and guaranteed its sovereignty, independence, prosperity and development by force of arms. True to his Songun idea and line, our Party has, since long ago, grasped military affairs and Party work as the key, and concentrated its efforts on strengthening our revolutionary armed forces politically, ideologically, militarily and technically, thus laying a firm foundation for developing its Songun-based revolutionary leadership at a new, higher stage. The Songun-based revolutionary line, Songun politics, that our Party is pursuing now, is a great revolutionary line of our era, the basic mode of socialist politics, that gives top priority to military affairs over all other affairs of State, that safeguards the country, the revolution and socialism by strengthening the Korean People’s Army to the maximum, and that builds up the driving force of the revolution and pushes ahead with socialist construction with the army as the core, as the main force. With regard to the system of State administration, we ensured that the authority of the National Defence Commission was strengthened and a system was established whereby the Commission guides and 17 administers defence affairs overall, so that all work in the revolution and construction was conducted strictly on the principle of giving precedence to military affairs. Our Songun politics, because it is rooted in the Juche idea and fully embodies and encompasses the Juche-oriented principles, strategy and tactics of the revolution and its methods and art of leadership, is the ever-victorious banner of our country and revolution and an all-powerful sword in the revolution and construction. The paramount strength of a nation rests with its military might. Our anti-imperialist, anti-US struggle is waged fiercely on all fronts of politics, the military, the economy, ideology and culture, and the main front that decides the destiny of the country and nation is the anti-imperialist military front. The confrontation with the imperialist aggressive forces is, in essence, a showdown of strength, and strength alone can make sense in relations with the imperialists. Without our own strength, our own powerful self-defensive military might, we can neither win the fight against the imperialists, nor defend the Party and the State, nor guarantee the safety of the people. This is the stark reality of today. By dint of its Songun-based revolutionary leadership, Songun politics, our Party has strengthened and developed the Korean People’s Army as the army of the Party and the leader, as the invincible revolutionary armed forces, both in name and in reality. The monolithic leadership system of the Party, the command system of the Supreme Commander and revolutionary military traits have been firmly established in the People’s Army, and the entire army–from the Supreme Commander down to the rank and file–now forms an integral whole based on revolutionary comradeship. All the men and officers of the People’s Army, cherishing an unshakable 18 ideology and faith, constitute an invincible armed force that has acquired a mastery of our style of strategy and tactics and is equipped with up-to-date military hardware. Our Jucheoriented defence industry has become able to produce every type of powerful state-of-the-art weaponry and military hardware and means, and the spirit of giving importance to military affairs has been established throughout society, with the result that the work of arming all the people and fortifying the whole country is proceeding at a higher phase. Thanks to the Songun politics, our Republic has frustrated all the challenges of the imperialist reactionaries and all their schemes to isolate and stifle it, and demonstrated its invincible military might to the world, and our socialist country, Songun Korea, has risen as a world-class military power that no aggressor dares to attack. As a result of the Songun-based revolutionary leadership, Songun politics, of the Party, the politico-ideological position of our Republic has been made rock-solid, and great progress has been made on the economic and cultural fronts. On the road of Songun our army and people have successfully achieved great unity–oneness of ideology and workstyle on the pattern of the revolutionary spirit and the workstyle of the soldiers–and the politico-ideological might of the country and the revolution has been enhanced beyond any comparison. Under the Party’s Songun-based leadership the army and the people have carried out all their undertakings in socialist construction in a revolutionary and militant manner by forming an integral whole, and have in this way implemented grand projects to transform the appearance of the country, build numerous monumental structures, develop science and technology by leaps and bounds, and usher in a new golden age of culture and the arts of the Songun era. 19 Thanks to our Songun-based policy of national reunification and the concerted efforts of the nation, the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration (2000) and the October 4 Declaration (2007) were adopted and made public, and this opened up an epoch-making phase in the reunification of the country. The national spirit for reunifying the country independently has been raised to an unprecedented height in the north, the south and abroad, and the movement for national reunification is developing as a nationwide movement under the banner of “by our nation itself.” Our Songun politics, which stands against the imperialists’ policies of invasion and war and for the independence of the country and nation, arouses great sympathy among the progressive peoples of the world and greatly contributes to global peace and the cause of mankind’s independence. Our Songun politics and independent foreign policy have made it possible to raise the prestige and influence of our Republic to an unprecedented level in the international arena and to develop its external relations rapidly. Under the leadership of President Kim Il Sung and our Party the DPRK was built and developed into a Juche-oriented socialist State with invincible might and achieved worldstartling victories and changes by overcoming every manner of historical challenge. The glorious country of Kim Il Sung, socialist Korea, that shines with brilliance by dint of Juche and Songun, is displaying its might as a great socialist country, and for this it is warmly loved and held aloft by our people as their great motherly country, is highly regarded by all Koreans as the pride and honour of the whole nation and as the fortress of national reunification, and is attracting the attention and admiration of people the world over. 20 3 Our Republic has travelled a long, long revolutionary path under the unfurled banner of the Juche idea, the banner of Songun, but our revolution is yet to be accomplished. We must build a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country on this land and realize the cause of national reunification through the great unity of the whole nation. We must make proactive efforts, shoulder to shoulder with all countries and progressive peoples that aspire to independence, to defend world peace and accomplish the cause of human independence. To build a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country true to President Kim Il Sung ’s lifelong wish is a sacred duty our Party and State have assumed before the times and the revolution. Under our Party’s Songun-based revolutionary leadership, the whole Party, the entire army and all the people must, with firm confidence in victory, step up with vigour the general march of the Songun-based revolution towards building a great, prosperous and powerful country. We must, first of all, build up the political and ideological position of our socialist country. The might of socialism is its political and ideological might, and consolidating the political and ideological position of the socialist country is essential for building a great, prosperous and powerful country. In keeping with the development of the revolution and construction, we must conduct ideological work proactively so as to display to the maximum the inexhaustible spiritual strength of our soldiers and people and give fuller play to the dignity of socialist Korea as a political and ideological power. 21 We must intensify education in the Juche idea, the Songun idea, among cadres, Party members and other working people, so that they can work and live in a revolutionary and militant fashion as befits revolutionary people of the new era of the Juche-oriented revolution, the Songun era. We must give them in-depth and effective class, revolutionary, socialist and other forms of education so as to ensure that they are imbued with high class and revolutionary awareness, a firm conviction in socialism and the spirit of socialist patriotism. We must consolidate the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks so that it is like steel. The core of our single-hearted unity is the leadership of the revolution. All cadres, Party members, soldiers and people must defend the leadership of the revolution politically and ideologically even at the risk of their lives, in the spirit of performing death-defying deeds in defence of the leader. All the men and officers of the People’s Army and all the people must be united more solidly around our Party in ideology and purpose, morality and obligation, and loyally support its ideas and leadership. Single-hearted unity is the great foundation of our revolution, and public sentiment is the great foundation of our single-hearted unity. We must fully understand the public sentiment and work effectively with people so as to constantly strengthen the single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks. We must remain vigilant against the enemy’s attempts to shatter our political and ideological position and undermine our single-hearted unity, and deal resolutely with them. We must wage a strenuous struggle to frustrate the manoeuvres of the imperialists and reactionaries to infiltrate us ideologically and culturally and wage a psychological smear campaign against us, and we must intensify the ideological campaign in such a 22 way as to prevent every element of the bourgeois ideology and way of life, however insignificant, from infiltrating our country. We must continue, under the banner of Songun, to invest great efforts in strengthening the country’s defence capabilities. Its defence capabilities represent the sovereignty of Songun Korea, its right to existence, and its authority, dignity and destiny. It is only by continually strengthening our defence capabilities that we can defend the security of the country and people and provide the decisive military guarantee for building a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country. The People’s Army is the main force of our revolution and the core force of our national defence. In our Songun politics, military affairs are given top priority and enhancing the People’s Army is the key element. What is most important in strengthening the People’s Army is thoroughly to establish the monolithic leadership system of the Supreme Commander, his command system, in the army. The entire army must loyally support its Supreme Commander’s ideas and leadership, share its destiny with him and move as one under his orders and instructions. We must enhance the People’s Army’s political, ideological, military and technical preparedness. The People’s Army must intensify the political work of the Party so as to ensure that all service personnel acquire political and ideological traits befitting the army of the Party and the leader, the army of the Supreme Commander, and it must give fuller play to the traits of unity between men and officers based on revolutionary comradeship. The soldiers and the people must share life and death on the road of Songun under the leadership of the Party, and consolidate their great unity. By carrying out 23 Party policy on training, all service personnel must train themselves into a-match-for-a-hundred combatants who are well versed in our particular strategies, tactics and art of warfare and who can skillfully apply them in actual combat. The armaments and other equipment of the People’s Army must be modernized constantly based on the latest science and technology. The men and officers of the People’s Army, fully aware of the importance of the duty they have assumed before the Party and the revolution, the country and the people, must make the defence lines of the country impregnable and play a vanguard role in socialist construction. An atmosphere must be created in which military affairs are given importance throughout society, and then all the people must learn military affairs earnestly and the entire Party, the whole country and all the people must make thorough preparations to cope with any emergency and, by building ever-stronger defences, turn the whole country into an impregnable fortress. We must build our country into an economically powerful State by stepping up socialist economic construction. Today economic construction is at the forefront in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful nation. Only by building our country into a socialist economic power by accelerating economic construction can we further strengthen the political and military might of Songun Korea, make it rich and strong and radically improve the people’s standard of living. We have set ourselves the ambitious goal of opening the gate of a great, prosperous and powerful country in 2012 when we will be celebrating the hundredth anniversary of the birth of President Kim Il Sung. If we are to achieve this goal, we must bring about a new revolutionary turn in socialist economic construction, and 24 thus strengthen the country’s economic might and solve once and for all the problem of the people’s living. The entire Party, the whole country and all the people must turn out to launch a general economic construction offensive. In order to bring about a revolutionary turn in economic construction, we must thoroughly implement the line of economic construction for the Songun era put forward by the Party. As demanded by this line, we must give priority to the development of the defence industry and develop light industry and agriculture simultaneously so as to effect a drastic turn in improving the people’s standard of living. Giving precedence to the vanguard sectors of the national economy, the basic industrial sectors, is the key to developing the defence industry, light industry and agriculture quickly and simultaneously. We must concentrate nationwide efforts on these sectors so as to shore up the power, coal-mining and metallurgical industries and rail transport, and thus open wide the road of advance in building an economically powerful country. By carrying out the Party’s line of attaching importance to science and technology, we must push forward the frontiers of cutting-edge science and technology and raise the country’s science and technology to a high level. All sectors of the national economy must proactively push ahead with the modernization of factories and enterprises as required in the IT age and based on the latest science and technology. We must improve the management of the socialist economy. In economic management it is essential strictly to observe socialist principles, to apply the method of collective management correctly, to strengthen the central and coordinated guidance of the State and, on the basis of this, to give full play to the creativity of the lower units. We 25 must enlist all potential and all the latent resources to the fullest and effectively on the principle of self-reliance and thus step up the building of an economic power by drawing on our own efforts, technology and resources. We must comprehensively develop education, the health service, art and literature, and all other fields in the building of socialist culture. We must train revolutionary talents in greater numbers and more qualitatively and give full play to the advantages of the people-oriented public health system by improving educational and public health work, and also bring into fuller bloom Juche-oriented art and literature, the art and literature of the Songun era. We must, by vigorously stepping up the general march of the Songun revolution, build a great, prosperous and powerful socialist country on this land and thus achieve a decisive victory in carrying out the cause of President Kim Il Sung, the socialist cause of Juche. Reunification is the supreme task of the Korean nation, and it brooks no further delay. The Korean nation, which continuously handed down its tradition as a homogeneous nation throughout history, has been divided into north and south for over 60 years. We must reunify the country at the earliest possible date, and thus put an end to the tragic history of national division and pave the way for the coordinated development and prosperity of the country and nation. The banners that our nation must hold up in achieving the independent reunification of the country are the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and October 4 Declaration. These declarations are declarations of national independence and great national unity and great programmes for national reunification. The standpoint and attitude towards these historic declarations constitute a 26 standard by which to distinguish collaboration from confrontation, reunification from division between north and south. Whoever earnestly desires national reunification must support these declarations and implement them faithfully. The basic ideal of national reunification as stated in the declarations is “by our nation itself,” and this is, to the core, the ideal of national independence, the ideal of national unity. All the compatriots in the north, the south and abroad must achieve national unity on the principle of national independence and frustrate all the manoeuvres of the antireunification forces and accomplish the cause of national reunification without fail through the united efforts of the Korean nation itself. We must make vigorous efforts to expand and develop the country’s external relations and realize global independence. The government of our Republic must conduct its external activities briskly in accordance with the ideals of independence, peace and friendship and as required by the changing situation, so as to increase the number of supporters of and sympathizers with our revolution and create an international environment that is favourable for building a great, prosperous and powerful socialist nation and achieving national reunification. By strengthening friendship and unity with all countries and all progressive peoples who aspire to independence, we must wage a vigorous struggle to frustrate the war policy and hegemonic moves of the imperialist aggressive forces, defend peace and realize global independence. In order for our Party and State to fulfil their mission and duty before the times and the revolution, it is important to strengthen the government of the Republic and enhance its role. 27 We must carry out President Kim Il Sung’s ideas and theories on State building and our Party’s line of State building in the Songun era, and thus continuously develop the government of the Republic.",historic

24.02.2009,Kim Jong Il,"Hoeryong is a sacred and historic revolutionary place, where the anti-Japanese war heroine Kim Jong Suk was born and spent her childhood. Today, I have managed to find the time to visit the bronze statue of my mother, her birthplace and the revolutionary museum. Gazing at her bronze statue in Hoeryong, my yearning for her grows stronger. My mother passed away too early. Her life, though short, was truly worthwhile. Before being a mother to a family, she was a loyal soldier of the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung and his closest comrade, a daughter of our country and people. She embarked on the road of revolution in her early years and, to the last moment of her life, devoted herself heart and soul to the leader, the country and the people. There has been no such a great mother in the world as mine, who devoted her entire life to her leader, country and people. Hers was a life of loyalty to the leader, of struggle for the revolution and of devotion to the people’s well-being. Indeed, it was the life of a great revolutionary and great mother, the brilliant life of a bodyguard who was unfailingly faithful to the leader. Since her life was so brilliant and worthwhile, our people still recollect her with deep yearning. For the imperishable exploits she performed for the good of her country and people, for the times and history, my mother will live for ever in the hearts of our people. The bronze statue of my mother in Hoeryong originally depicted her in the traditional Korean chima and jogori dress. The leader said that a military uniform would be better suited to her revolutionary career, so the statue was re-sculpted as he instructed. 1 Even now the statue looks immaculate. At the time of its re-sculpting I focused all my energies on it. The statue in Hoeryong looks the best of all the bronze statues of my mother erected in different parts of the country. It looks even better than the one at Kim Jong Suk Naval University. The bronze statue in Hoeryong is in an excellent location and it is appropriate in all respects. The city is keeping the statue in a good state of maintenance. I agree to your proposal that I pose for a photograph in front of the statue. Let us all pose for one after that. Judging by your smiles, I think you must have been looking forward to my coming to Hoeryong to pose for the camera in front of the bronze statue of my mother today. You, the director of the Museum of Comrade Kim Jong Suk’s Revolutionary Activities, say that you were born in Unsan County, South Phyongan Province, graduated from Chongjin O Jung Hup University of Education No. 1 and took a postgraduate course at Kim Hyong Jik University of Education. That is good. You say that you will work harder with pride in living in Hoeryong, the birthplace of my mother. I am confident that you will do so. The officials in Hoeryong have thanked me for visiting the city on such a cold day and guiding its overall work. In the future you should work harder and repay the Party for its trust in you. It is important for Hoeryong to look after the bronze statue of my mother with utmost care and conduct effective education by means of it. At my mother’s birthplace, I feel my heart overflowing with deep emotion. I had the urge to visit Hoeryong whenever I was missing my mother, but I could not find the time to do so because of my heavy workload. In the 1970s, when guiding 2 the construction of the Wangjaesan Revolutionary Site, I passed by Hoeryong on the train several times. Yet I could not spare the time to come here. I crossed the Tuman River by train in 2001 and 2002 when I was coming to and from the Russian Federation and its Far East region, respectively. Then, because of my tight schedule, I could not drop in on my mother’s birthplace, even though it was within hailing distance. My mother did not return to her birthplace at Hoeryong, either. After she came back to the homeland her comrades-in-arms tried to persuade her to visit Hoeryong on several occasions. Each time, however, she declined, saying that she was unable to pay a visit then and would find the time later because she had many pressing issues to deal with in assisting General Kim Il Sung. So she delayed her visit and ultimately failed to come here. Her birthplace at Hoeryong is a historic site that brings back deep memories of my mother. She was born and spent her childhood in a poor family. Her family was so destitute that they lived in a small room attached to someone else’s house, as you can see. Few people today would believe that a great revolutionary was born in such a house. My mother’s was a patriotic and revolutionary family that, in the years of national distress, fought the Japanese aggressors for the good of their country and people. As she was born and grew up in such a family, my mother at a young age harboured a bitter hatred for the Japanese imperialists, the enemy who were imposing every manner of misfortune and suffering on our people. So she was resolute in her decision to take part in the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle led by Comrade Kim Il Sung, and earned a worldwide reputation as a 3 woman general of the guerrilla army. The marker recording my mother’s revolutionary activities is inscribed with the words to the effect that she was born in this house on December 24, 1917 and nurtured a great patriotic aim while experiencing the sorrow of a stateless nation and a wretched life. Having lived in a grass hut by the Phalul Stream, her family moved to this house two years before her birth. They built one more room, attached to the single-room dwelling. It is said that they were on good terms with the villagers. At the age of 5 she and her parents left this house for north Jiandao. They probably felt they were forced to cross the Tuman River since her father, who was involved in the independence movement, was subjected to severe persecution by the Japanese police and they were deprived of even their small plot of rented land. The trees around the education yard at the house are, I think, firs. You say that it will be memorable for me to pose for a photograph in front of my mother’s old home. I agree with you. My mother’s old home is a historic place bearing traces of her great life. In Hoeryong they should properly maintain the house and conduct effective education by means of it. The curator is worried that I may catch flu in this cold weather. I am all right. It is a good thing that the Museum of Comrade Kim Jong Suk’s Revolutionary Activities was inaugurated on August 25, 1982, to mark the 65th anniversary of her birth. The large Korean painting New Spring of National Liberation in room 1 at the museum is excellent. It is good that the Map Showing the Major Sites Related to the 4 Revolutionary Activities of the Anti-Japanese War Heroine Kim Jong Suk is made of nylon and is marked out to divide her revolutionary career into 13 stages. There is another map showing her activities in the Paektusan Secret Camp, Pyongyang and Chongjin. The researchers at the Institute of Geography under the State Academy of Sciences should be praised for producing the Map Showing the Major Sites Related to the Revolutionary Activities of the Anti-Japanese War Heroine Kim Jong Suk and sending it here to mark the 90th anniversary of her birth. Room 2 exhibits materials concerning her birth and childhood in Hoeryong and the start of her revolutionary struggle in north Jiandao. Regarding her childhood, I have just been told about it at her old home. This is a mill she operated by hand at a landlord’s house when she was living in Fuyandong. Room 4 exhibits materials concerning her vanguard role in the fight to defend a guerrilla base and her first meeting with the leader at the Sandaowan guerrilla base. I have been told that she was delighted to meet the leader for the first time in Nengzhiying, Sandaowan, in March 1935, and that she made a firm resolve to fight on to the end with unshakeable trust in him. Room 5 exhibits materials concerning her joining the Korean People’s Revolutionary Army in her teens and taking up arms to act as a bodyguard for the leader. Her joining the KPRA was a historic milestone in her revolutionary career. By joining the KPRA, which had been formed and was commanded by the great leader, she realized her wish to become involved in the sacred war to liberate the country, and stood at his side in supporting his ideology and lines. Room 6 exhibits materials concerning the great exploits 5 she performed when establishing a base on Mt Paektu. She fought in death-defying defence of the leader on a hill during the assault on Fusong county town. In recalling the battle, the leader said that the headquarters had been saved that day by my mother and other women soldiers who had waged a heroic battle to defend the hill. The letters on the slogan-bearing trees protected by tubes in the education room where slogan-bearing trees are preserved seem to be fading. You say that of the 112 slogan-bearing trees discovered in Hoeryong, 18 are attributed to anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters and 94, to members of revolutionary organizations; the number of slogan-bearing trees discovered in the city is huge. Room 9 exhibits materials concerning my mother’s activities in the Yonsa and Musan areas, true to the leader’s noble intentions. This is a photograph of Mother Jang Chol Gu. Room 10 exhibits materials concerning her exertions to protect the leader’s health and safety during the small-unit actions. The picture of her taken with the leader, greeting the spring in a foreign land on March 1, 1941, is profoundly significant. Room 13 exhibits materials concerning the exploits she performed for the cause of army building, particularly the photograph in which I, together with the leader and my mother, am attending the second-term graduation ceremony of the First Central Military Academy. My mother paid close concern to strengthening and developing our revolutionary armed forces, striving with her heart and soul to implement the leader’s line of army building. The exploits she performed in the history of army building are truly great. Room 14 exhibits materials concerning her guidance to the 6 sectors of the economy, culture, education and public health; notably, there is a picture of me with the leader and my mother in Kyongsong, taken in September 1947. Room 16 displays the first uniforms which were prepared under her meticulous care and sent to the bereaved children at Mangyongdae Revolutionary School. She often visited the school to see the children there and took warm care of their studying and lives with maternal affection. She strove with all her heart to train the bereaved children of revolutionaries into genuine revolutionaries who were unfailingly loyal to the leader, into hardcore elements who would carry forward the bloodline of our revolution. Room 17 exhibits materials showing how faithfully she supported the leader to the last moment of her life. It also displays photographs I sent on the occasion of her 80th birthday. From her early years when she embarked on the road of revolution, to the last moment of her life, my mother worked with devotion for the leader, for national liberation and the victory of the revolution, and for the people’s well-being. You say that about 200 000 people visit the Museum of Comrade Kim Jong Suk’s Revolutionary Activities every year. This is quite a large number of visitors. Today, in looking round the museum, I have seen a great deal of data and relics relating to her revolutionary activities. I have seen the picture album for the museum before. The exhibits in the museum are excellent, but the building itself is not so good. The building is too big and its floor height too great. It looks more like a house of culture than a museum. The hall of the museum is so high that my neck aches when I look up at the ceiling. The rooms in the museum have a lot of windows. It is hard to maintain a normal 7 temperature in a building with rooms that have a high ceiling and a lot of windows–all the more so in such a cold region as Hoeryong. You say that you have installed 15 air-conditioners, but maintaining the museum’s indoor temperature will be difficult because of all the windows. I think that not enough attention was paid to the matter of heating at the time when the museum was being built. This museum was not designed well. Compared with the small size of Hoeryong, it is too big and not well laid out. It is not suitable in several aspects. The design of the museum must have been modelled on a foreign one. To an architect, the defects in the design of this museum are obvious. You say that originally, the Hoeryong Revolutionary Museum was built on a small scale beside the statue of my mother and it was rebuilt on a bigger scale in view of her great exploits and the people’s earnest wish. At that time it was considered right to build a revolutionary museum on a large scale. But if this museum had been smaller, it would have been possible to build a new school. In the future, designing and planning should be done well when building a revolutionary museum. A museum does not need a lot of windows. There are no windows in the International Friendship Exhibition House. If a museum has a lot of windows, it will be hard to maintain the indoor temperature and the historical remains and relics may be harmed by the sunlight. When constructing a museum you should not import expensive materials or design it as a large building for no good reason. There are many instances of people vying with one another to build and furnish museums or rooms for education by means of revolutionary relics by purchasing materials from abroad; this practice must no longer be allowed. 8 If a big museum is built for no justifiable reason, a lot of materials will be wasted. It seems to me that large amounts of materials and funds were expended in erecting this museum. As for such academic issues as displaying data and arranging relics in a museum, you must follow the directives from the Party History Institute of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea. Today I have pointed to the large size of this museum and the many windows, but you should not try to remodel it and instead leave it as it is. It will do to take these matters into account in the future when you are building a museum. I am afraid that you, the head of the education section at the museum, must be feeling cold as you are wearing chima and jogori. The visitors are dressed in padded clothes, so they are all right. But you may get cold, dressed as you are and standing all day long to give a lecture. The museum director is probably not so cold, as she is wearing an overcoat. But I think that in this region you should wear padded clothes rather than such an overcoat. A few years back, I had sets of padded clothes and fur boots sent to the lecturers at the revolutionary battle sites in Ryanggang Province. They were all delighted. I will have padded clothes sent to you all, too. In Hoeryong the Museum of Comrade Kim Jong Suk’s Revolutionary Activities needs to be renovated and effective education conducted through it. Large numbers of people visit the museum, and you should give them a good understanding of our Party’s revolutionary traditions, and the anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters’ ennobling spirit of defending the leader to the death and their indomitable revolutionary spirit. The generations change with the passage of time, but the cause of our revolution, which started its advance on Mt Paektu, is yet to be accomplished. Now, as we struggle to 9 build a thriving socialist country under the unfurled banner of Songun, we are in acute confrontation with the imperialists. The more complex the situation grows and the more gigantic the revolutionary task facing us, the more important education in our revolutionary traditions becomes. Party organizations and working people’s organizations at all levels should intensify more than ever before, education in our revolutionary traditions among Party members, working people, young people and children. The staff of the museum have pledged to be faithful to the leader like my mother Kim Jong Suk; I believe in you. You should all work hard.",hoeryong sacred historic revolutionary place anti japanese war heroine jong suk bear spend childhood today manage find visit bronze statue mother birthplace revolutionary

08.05.2010,Kim Jong Il,"I am very pleased to visit China again at warm invitation of Comrade General Secretary Hu Jintao and have meaningful meetings with you and other Chinese comrades. Allow me to express, first of all, my profound thanks to you for having arranged this grand banquet for us and made such excellent speech despite your very tight schedule. I would like to express, at the same time, gratitude to you for having organized detailed and meticulous itineraries for our visits to Dalian and Tianjin. My thanks also go to comrades in Beijing and local areas for having warmly greeted and accorded cordial hospitality to us. We came to your country in this beautiful season when it greeted spring after standing heaviest snowfall and bitterest cold in several decades. We toured northeastern China which we had long wished to see, keenly feeling the friendship of the fraternal Chinese people warmer than spring sunshine, the gift of nature. During our visit we saw for ourselves fresh world-startling changes brought about by the people in northeastern China in political, economic, cultural and all other fields, pursuant to the strategy to develop the northeastern region, an old industrial base, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China with you as its general secretary. We were deeply impressed particularly by the new appearance of Dalian and Tianjin which have undergone a remarkable change after doing away with the centuries-old backwardness; these cities were once harshly exploited and trampled down after being reduced to settlements of the imperialist powers and theatres of scrambles for expanding the sphere of their influence in the 19th century. Witnessing the stirring reality in which hundreds of millions of Chinese people, who had been subject to all sorts of contempt and insult in the past, are now building a rich and powerful socialist country in the vast land of China full of energy, we came to know well that the policies of the Communist Party of China are very just ones suited to the actual conditions of China and they are fully displaying their vitalities wherever one goes in China. These eye-opening events taking place in socialist China at present once again prove the truth that ""There Is No New China without the Communist Party"" just as one can know from the song of the same title. The fact that everything goes well in China, our fraternal neighbor, hardens the faith that socialism chosen and defended by us is sure to triumph. It is our firm belief that the fraternal Chinese people will unite closer around the CPC Central Committee with you Comrade Hu Jintao as its general secretary and thoroughly embody the spirit of the 17th Congress of the CPC, guided by the Deng Xiaoping's theory, the important thought of ""three represents"" and the scientific outlook on development under the uplifted great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics and thus build a harmoniously developed socialist society and certainly achieve the complete reunification of the whole country. We sincerely hope that they will thoroughly implement the tasks set forth at the 3rd Session of the 11th National People's Congress for the present to fully attain this year the goal of economic and social development envisaged in the period of the 11th Five-Year Plan, maintain stable and sustained economic development, and successfully host the Shanghai World Expo that opened with splendor and the forthcoming Guangzhou Asian Games and thus demonstrate once again the national power of prospering China before the whole world. Touring this time northeastern China, which bears historic witness to the DPRK-China friendship, we could realize once again the value of DPRK-China friendship, the common wealth of the two countries which President Kim Il Sung provided while waging the hard-fought anti-Japanese struggle together with Chinese revolutionaries of the elder generation in his early years and bequeathed to us. We are very grateful to the collective leadership of the Chinese party for having paid deep attention to boosting the friendly relations with the DPRK while consistently attaching importance to the bilateral relations from a strategic point of view and rendered sincere support and encouragement to the socialist cause of the Korean people. The traditional DPRK-China relations of friendship that stood all tests of history century after century have powerfully encouraged the peoples of the two countries in their efforts to accomplish the socialist cause and made great contributions to protecting peace and stability in Northeast Asia including the Korean Peninsula and, furthermore, in the rest of the world. Our two countries fixed last year as ""year of DPRK-China friendship"", the first of its kind in history, and successfully organized visits of high-level delegations and significant events, powerfully demonstrating the unbreakable DPRK-China friendship internally and externally. I am pleased that the DPRK-China friendship deeply enshrined by the two peoples has steadily grown stronger. I am very satisfied with the fact that my visit to China, in particular, provided a good occasion in further deepening the trust between the two countries and boosting the mutual understanding. Our Party and government will as ever make every possible effort to inject fresh vitality into boosting the DPRK-China friendship, the common treasure, in all fields",pleased visit china again warm invitation general secretary jintao meaningful meeting chinese comrade allow express first profound thank having arrange grand banquet excellent despite your tight schedule express same gratitude having organize detailed meticulous itinerary visit dalian tianjin thank comrade beijing local area having warmly greet accord cordial hospitality your beautiful season greet spring stand heavy snowfall bitterest cold several decade tour northeastern china have long wish keenly feel friendship fraternal chinese warm than spring sunshine gift nature during visit see ourselves fresh startle change bring northeastern china political cultural field pursuant strategy northeastern region old industrial base leadership communist party china general secretary be deeply impressed particularly new appearance dalian tianjin undergo remarkable change do away century old backwardness these city be once harshly exploit trample down be reduce settlement imperialist power theatre scramble expand sphere influence century witness stir reality hundred million chinese have subject sort contempt insult past now build rich socialist vast land china full energy know policy communist party china one suit actual condition china fully display vitality wherever go china these eye open event take place socialist china present once again prove truth there new china communist party know song same title fact everything go china fraternal neighbor harden faith socialism choose defend sure triumph firm belief fraternal chinese unite close cpc central committee jintao general secretary thoroughly embody spirit congress cpc guide deng xiaoping theory important thought represent scientific outlook uplifted banner socialism chinese characteristic harmoniously develop socialist society certainly achieve complete reunification sincerely hope thoroughly implement task set forth session congress present fully attain goal social envisage period five plan maintain stable sustained successfully host shanghai expo open splendor forthcoming guangzhou asian game demonstrate once again power prosper china before tour northeastern china bear historic witness dprk china friendship realize once again value dprk china friendship common wealth country sung provide while wage hard fight anti japanese struggle together chinese revolutionary elder generation early year bequeath grateful collective leadership chinese party having pay deep attention boost friendly relation dprk while consistently attach importance bilateral relation strategic point view render sincere support encouragement socialist traditional dprk china relation friendship stand test history century century powerfully encourage people country effort accomplish socialist contribution protect peace stability northeast asia include peninsula furthermore rest country fix last dprk china friendship first kind history successfully organize visit level delegation significant event powerfully demonstrate unbreakable dprk china friendship internally externally pleased dprk china friendship deeply enshrine people steadily grow strong satisfied fact visit china particular provide occasion far deepen trust country boost mutual understanding party government ever possible effort inject fresh vitality into boost dprk china friendship common treasure field
07.10.2011,Kim Jong Il,"A decisive improvement needs to be made in our public health service. The public health service, since its purpose is to safeguard lives and improve people’s health, is one of the most important features of our people-centred socialist society and a basic undertaking aimed at stabilizing and raising the quality of life. People, if they are unhealthy, cannot display great mental strength and creativity, fulfil their revolutionary tasks or enjoy a genuinely worthwhile and happy life. Only when they are healthy can they work and live, filled with vigour and enthusiasm, and be fully committed to their labour and national defence. Our socialist healthcare system was bequeathed to us by the great Comrade Kim Il Sung, and achieving a decisive improvement in the public health service is now a key political task for defending it and displaying its advantages to the utmost and an urgent requirement of the present situation. Under our most advantageous people-oriented healthcare system, the Party and the state assume full responsibility for caring for the lives and health of the people. 1 Its advantages are evident in the system and policy of complete and universal free medical care. From birth, everyone in our country has the right to free medical treatment. Hospitals and clinics are located in every urban centre and rural village so that, wherever they are living, people enjoy convenient access to medical treatment. Our people know nothing of such expressions as outpatient service charges, price of medicine, operation charges, and inpatient service charges. Under the district doctor system, doctors check the health of the people in their charge on a regular basis and take an immediate action when a problem occurs. Our public health institutions and workers feel it as their natural duty and an honourable task to take responsibility for and protect the lives and health of the people, and our medical personnel routinely perform such ennobling and laudable deeds as donating their blood, skin and even bones to the sick. All this testifies to the validity, advantages and great vitality of our country’s socialist public health system and the people-oriented public health policy of the Party and state–a system and policy that would be unimaginable in capitalist society, where money rules 2 everything and the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. However, the deterioration in our country’s economic situation in the 1990s, particularly since the start of the Arduous March, impacted the public health sector, like other sectors, and the aftereffects are still being felt. Today, public health is one of the backward sectors in our country and is failing to display to the full the advantages of the socialist healthcare system. Some hospitals have outdated medical facilities and are not being provided with sufficient medical appliances and supplies. The unsatisfactory production and supply of medicines is impeding the efforts to prevent and cure diseases. This is the case, to varying degrees, not only at regional hospitals but even at central ones. Comrade Kim Il Sung established the most advantageous socialist healthcare system and universal free medical care over half a century ago, but its advantages are currently dwindling. We must not tolerate this. The country’s public health service has come to this pass because officials of the Cabinet, the Ministry of 3 Public Health, other ministries and national agencies concerned and government organs at all levels have neglected public health work. Because of their defeatist attitude, they have failed to make persistent efforts to carry out the Party’s people-oriented public health policy. If they had approached the work in a revolutionary and audacious manner, displaying the revolutionary soldier spirit in accordance with the Party’s idea and intention, they could have defended and glorified our socialist healthcare system, despite the country’s economic situation and the difficulties they encountered. In recent years, however, they have lost motivation and, while complaining about their poor working conditions, virtually neglected public health work. So, I severely criticized the officials concerned and took radical steps to bring about a revolutionary improvement in the public health sector. Only then did officials at the Ministry of Public Health and elsewhere come to their senses and, by setting out to implement the Party’s public health policy, achieve a certain degree of progress in their work. The material and technological foundations are 4 now being laid for bringing about a turn in the production of medicines and medical appliances, and a number of successes have been recorded in providing a more hygienic and civilized environment at hospitals at all levels. However, all this falls far short of a comprehensive overhaul of the public health service. The senior and all other officials of the Cabinet, the Ministry of Public Health, other ministries and national agencies concerned and regional Party and government organs should deeply cherish the ennobling intention of Comrade Kim Il Sung in ensuring that the universal free medical system was proclaimed and introduced during the arduous days of the Fatherland Liberation War. They should also uphold with a revolutionary faith and indomitable will the Songun politics, benevolent politics and energetic leadership of the Party which, when we were enduring the unprecedented hardships of the Arduous March, did everything possible to defend the people’s lives and safety and improve their health, and to stabilize and raise the quality of their life. By doing so they can add eternal brilliance to the advantages of the socialist healthcare system bequeathed to us by the leader. We should completely eradicate the disorder and 5 non-socialist practices revealed in public health work, ensure that it is put back on a normal track in all aspects and, furthermore, demonstrate to the full the advantages of our socialist healthcare system. We should effect a major change in our work, so that in every aspect the public health service, from the construction of modern hospitals and other medical service establishments, to the production of medicines and appliances and the modernization and scientification of disease treatment and prevention, is raised to the highest possible level, as required by the Songun era and for building a powerful socialist country. To this end, above all, officials of the state economic guidance organs, public health organs and government organs at all levels should rid themselves of their misguided attitude and viewpoint that led them to neglect public health work, and should establish a revolutionary climate of regarding the Party’s people-oriented public health policy as absolute and implementing it unconditionally. In particular, those at the Ministry of Public Health and others in the public health sector should, by acting more responsibly and effectively, bring about a radical improvement in their approach to, and style of, work. 6 Only then will they be able to organize and develop the overall public health service in a revolutionary and militant manner, as required by the Party’s ideas, intentions and policies. A decisive improvement should be made in the state’s management of and support for the public health service. The leader long ago said that the universal free medical system enforced in our country presupposes state investment and support, and that the country could enforce this system not because it had enough money but because it valued people’s lives and health so highly. He often stressed the need for the state to take responsibility for this work and ensure sufficient supplies for it. The Cabinet, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Public Health and other ministries and national agencies, government organs at different levels and all officials should strictly follow the leader’s instructions for improving the public health service and implement them to the letter. For the present, we should press ahead with rebuilding the hospitals, the basic units of the public health service, in line with hygienic and medical requirements, perfecting their features as centres for 7 medical treatment, and modernizing central and regional hospitals. Our country has very few modern hospitals that it can be proud of before the world. In the past, under the Party’s leadership, we built the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital, to the envy of the world; in recent years we have built the Academy of Koryo Medicine, the General Dental Hospital, a specialist ophthalmic hospital and the like, but we must never rest content with this. We should upgrade the existing hospitals on the basis of the latest science and technology, as befitting hospitals of a powerful socialist country; at the same time, we should build new up-to-date central and specialist hospitals. Hospitals in provinces, cities and counties, as well as factory hospitals and hospitals and clinics in rural villages, should be modernized in conformity with their specific situation. If a radical improvement is to be made in the public health service, it is essential to put the production of medicines and medical appliances on a modern and scientific basis. Otherwise, we cannot bring about a change in this work. 8 The pharmaceuticals industry should adopt proactive measures for mass-producing high-quality medicines in large quantities. In line with Party policies, the Ministry of Public Health should work with this industry to direct primary efforts at achieving a decisive increase in the production of household and over-the-counter medicines, including antibiotics, digestants, antipyretics and brain metabolic stimulants, so as to satisfy the demand for them. At the same time, they should work proactively to research and develop new, effective medicines that can be widely used in treatment and prevention. The pharmaceuticals industry should, in line with the instructions I gave during my field guidance there, modernize the Hungnam Pharmaceuticals Factory at a high level and as soon as possible. With this factory as a model, it should then upgrade other pharmaceuticals factories. The sectors concerned, including the chemicals industry, should establish strict discipline whereby the raw and other materials and the technical means needed for manufacturing medicines are produced and supplied in time and without fail. A major effort should be directed to the production of Koryo medicines, including insam, deer’s antler 9 and other tonics. The physical side-effects of these traditional medicines are negligible, but they are effective in treatment–characteristics that make them superior to Western medicines. The sector in charge of Koryo medicine production should mass-produce efficacious and easy-to-take traditional medicines by making use of the various medicinal herbs and materials that are abundant in our country, with a view to them taking the lion’s share in solving the problem of medicines. It should upgrade other factories, following the example of the Kanggye Koryo Medicine Factory, which has been transformed into a magnificent facility under the leadership of the Party, and hold fast to the Party’s policy of producing Koryo medicines in a scientific way and in the form of extracts. We should establish the discipline of ensuring that all medicines, whether Western or traditional, are standardized and registered by the state. Revolutionary measures should be adopted for producing and supplying modern, high-quality medical appliances. We have sent a satellite into orbit, created a strong nuclear deterrent, raised IT to the most advanced level and introduced CNC technology in the machine10 building and other sectors; so, there is no reason why we cannot produce modern medical appliances. The Cabinet, the Ministry of Public Health and other sectors concerned should hold fast to and carry out the Party’s policy on producing modern medical apparatuses and appliances by our own efforts. Factories and enterprises in the medical appliances field should modernize their production lines on the basis of the latest science and technology and increase the output and improve the quality of diagnostic and treatment apparatuses and medical appliances as appropriate to our specific situation. The Ministry of Public Health and the Academy of Medical Sciences, in cooperation with the State Academy of Sciences, should make energetic efforts to develop and produce modern medical apparatuses, including ultrasound diagnostic equipment, electrocardiographs, and apparatuses for dental and ophthalmic treatment. They should also mass-produce high-quality medical appliances such as syringes, thermometers, sphygmomanometers and stethoscopes, as well as disposables including bandages, gauze and cotton wool, to meet demand. A dynamic, bold struggle should be waged to 11 develop and produce the latest medical equipment and appliances. It is laudable that the Ministry of Public Health proposed repurposing the Mangyongdae X-ray Equipment Factory as an electronic medical appliances factory. This should be undertaken resolutely. The Cabinet and the sectors concerned should render active support to this project. The matter of importing state-of-the-art medical appliances factories should also be studied, even though it will entail spending some of the state budget. It will allow us to produce modern X-ray, CT and other cutting-edge medical apparatuses for ourselves. Along with doing all we can to increase the production of medicines and medical appliances and supplies, it is important to ensure that medical materials, once produced, are properly supplied. Hospitals should receive medicines as appropriate to the features of the local areas and population, and medical apparatuses and appliances according to their size and characteristics and specialist requirements. Strict discipline and order should be established by which the state coordinates the provision of medicines and other medical supplies, be they domestically12 produced or imported, and strict legal controls should be enforced to eliminate the illegal trade in medicines. Otherwise, the provision of medicines and other medical supplies may lapse into chaos, and fake and toxic medicines may spread that have a damaging effect on people’s lives and health. If we are to display the advantages of the socialist healthcare system to the full, we must bring about a turn in medical treatment and preventive work so as to ensure a satisfactorily high level of effectiveness in protecting and promoting people’s lives and health. In this way, we can raise average life expectancy, increase attendance at delivery and step up the prevention of infectious diseases, while reducing the infant mortality rate; then, before too long, we will not only meet the global health indices in these areas, but even lead the world. This is a key target our Party has set for the public health sector and a fighting task we can surely and must carry out without fail under our country’s socialist healthcare system. The key criterion in medical treatment is the devotion of the doctors and other medical personnel. Devotion is a key attribute and the lifeblood of a socialist public health service. 13 However skilled they may be, doctors cannot treat their patients properly if they are not devoted. As engineers of human life, they should display utmost sincerity and energy in treating the patients in their charge, with the attitude of taking ultimate responsibility for their lives and health, and they should explore and apply every possible means and method to ensure the success of their treatment. Only those who devote their all can be called faithful medical personnel of our Party and genuine medical workers of People’s Korea. Medical personnel should work strenuously to build up a rich store of medical scientific and technical knowledge and clinical experience. The only way they can acquire a high level of scientific and technical qualifications is through hard study and inquiry and diligent clinical practice. If they display complete devotion supported by a high level of medical scientific and technical expertise, they can save patients, even from the jaws of death, and cure any disease. Treatment methods should also be continuously improved and developed. There are countless types of disease, and the symptoms differ according to the patient’s gender, age 14 and physical constitution. So, a uniform treatment plan cannot guarantee a successful cure. Treatment should be carried out in accordance with the characteristics of each disease; to this end, medical workers should master a range of effective remedies. It is also beneficial in treating patients for doctors, departments and even hospitals, if needed, to conduct collective consultations, and cooperate. In particular, in putting medical treatment on a modern, scientific basis, such methods as organ transplant, laser therapy, laparoscopic surgery and gene therapy should be introduced proactively. The Party’s policy on preventive medicine should be thoroughly implemented. Our socialist medicine is preventive medicine. This is clearly indicative of the ennobling peopleoriented character of our medicine, which is fundamentally different from capitalist medicine, which gives illness first and then medicine. Thanks to the Party’s policy on preventive medicine, our country could fully stop the infiltration of AIDS, which is cutting a wide swathe through the world, and halt the infiltration and spread of SARS, avian flu and other contagious diseases. 15 The public health sector should further intensify the efforts to maintain more sanitary and civilized working and living conditions and prevent the spread of disease. To this end, it should establish a wellregulated system of hygiene and anti-epidemic measures and enhance the functions and role of the hygiene and anti-epidemic organs. In particular, it should organize more strictly the work of preventing the infiltration of SARS, AIDS and other global epidemics, and by doing so display more fully the advantages and vitality of our Party’s policy on preventive medicine. At the same time, it should adopt comprehensive measures for treating and preventing such contagious diseases as tuberculosis, hepatitis and parasitosis. Our medical personnel should join the effort to eradicate all contagious diseases with the confidence that they can do so under our system if their treatment and prevention work is stepped up and the people’s living standards are improved rapidly, in line with the Party’s ideas and intentions. The public health sector should further develop the district doctor system. Comrade Kim Il Sung established this system, in which medical workers in charge of certain residential 16 areas take care of the health of the local population on an on-going basis; he said long ago that the number of families in the charge of each doctor under the system should be reduced gradually so as to improve the quality of the medical service. True to his intention, we should increase the number of doctors, decrease the number of families under the charge of each one, and provide doctors with every condition they need for committing themselves fully to caring for the health of residents. The public health sector should establish a proper combination of Koryo and modern medicine. Developing Koryo medicine by combining it with modern medicine is an important policy of our Party. Koryo medicine is the traditional medicine of the Korean nation, and our ancestors treated their illnesses and improved their health with its help. In Koryo medicine, the patients’ pulses are examined to diagnose their conditions, and special therapies such as acupuncture, moxibustion, cupping and massage are employed to treat them and improve their health, along with medicines prepared from natural materials. These traditional therapies, since they were created and have developed historically on the basis of our 17 ancestors’ talent, wisdom and clinical experience, are highly effective and have many advantages. We should value and prioritize Koryo medicine and develop it as required by the times, on the principle of maintaining the Juche character and preserving the national identity of the public health sector. Only when we develop Koryo and modern medicine in proper combination can public health work overall achieve faster progress at a higher level in such areas as treatment and prevention and the promotion of Juche-oriented medical science and technology. To this end, medical and all other workers in these sectors should respect and consult one another and step up their mutual assistance and cooperation. However, this working spirit is currently very weak. This is attributable to the attitude of medical personnel in the public health sector, from its senior officials down to those at hospitals at all levels, who regard our traditional medicine as insignificant and unworthy. Such being the case, they are failing to ensure the proper combination of Koryo and modern medicine, to share the merits and overcome the demerits of each 18 and, in particular, to develop our traditional medicine at the high speed as required by the times. The main thing in developing Koryo medicine is to step up the study of its features and advantages and, at the same time, put its treatment methods and the production of the associated medicines on a scientific and modern basis. This can only be realized with the proactive assistance of officials and other workers in the field of modern medicine. On the other hand, only when modern medicine values the advantages and merits of Koryo medicine and introduces them sincerely, in line with scientific and technical principles, can overall treatment and preventive work be further developed. In order to carry out the Party’s policy on developing Koryo and modern medicine in proper combination, it is necessary, for the present, to take steps to increase the number of workers in the sector of Koryo medicine and to specialize in traditional therapies. At present, each central, provincial, city and county hospital has only one general department dealing with Koryo medicine, staffed by a handful of doctors. In this situation, it is impossible to develop our traditional medicine, put it on a scientific and modern 19 basis, and achieve a proper combination and cooperation between it and modern medicine. A specialized Koryo medicine department should be established according to the scale and features of each hospital, the size of its staff increased, and the position of vice-director in charge of traditional treatment established. Hospitals should also introduce a proper work system and methodology for developing Koryo and modern medicine in proper combination, as required by the Party’s policy, in order to ensure that the policy is fully implemented. In medical treatment and prevention, it is a good idea to make active use of our country’s abundant hot spring and other mineral water resources. Hot springs and other mineral waters can be found all across our country, and sanatoria, health resorts and holiday camps, as well as houses for rent, have been built there. Making proper use of them can prove effective in treating illness and protecting people’s health. The Ministry of Public Health and the sectors concerned should develop sanatoria, health resorts and holiday camps and ensure that they operate properly so that people can make effective use of the mineral 20 waters for treating their illnesses and promoting their health. In order to raise our public health service to the cutting-edge standard, medical science and technology need to undergo rapid and comprehensive development. Thanks to the Party’s commitment to breaking through the cutting-edge, and under its energetic leadership, science and technology in our country have witnessed radical development, but medical science and technology remain relatively backward compared to other fields. This is the IT era, the era of the knowledge-driven economy, and the times demand that medical science and technology should also be raised to the cuttingedge level. If medical science and technology are to make rapid progress, above all the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Academy of Koryo Medicine and other research institutions should play a more prominent role. The two academies are central organs that have been put in charge of research into the country’s medical science and technology by the Party and state. They should enlist the institutes and researchers 21 under their control in their efforts to solve the important and most pressing scientific and technical problems and, in particular, to develop the latest medical science and technology that can be adopted in medical treatment and disease prevention. They should draw up proper plans for developing the country’s medical science and technology in line with the requirements of Party policies, the reality and world trends in this regard, and implement them one by one and in stages. The scientists, technicians and workers in the public health sector, including those at medical science institutions, true to the Party’s call to keep our feet firmly planted on our own land while looking out over the world, should all turn out to effect a great change in medical science and technology by displaying a sharp insight into the contemporary situation and ardent creative enthusiasm. By concentrating, among other things, on putting therapy on a scientific footing, developing efficacious medicines and updating medical apparatuses, they should break through the cutting-edge. They should readjust and expand telemedicine linking the capital city with the provinces, cities and counties, ensure that it functions properly, introduce 22 IT into medical services and raise hospital management to a high scientific level. They should also work proactively to introduce advanced medical science and technology from other countries, in accordance with our reality. We should send our public health officials, scientists and technicians for visits and internships to other countries with more advanced medical technology, and conduct active exchange in all aspects of medical science and technology with other countries. In order to bring the advantages of the socialist healthcare system into full play, medical schools and other educational institutions in the public health sector should develop the training of talented medical science and technology personnel on a long-term basis. Medical schools should build up the ranks of their teaching staff and modernize their material and technical foundations so as to turn out medical personnel, scientists and technicians with high political, ideological, scientific and technical qualifications. The quality of education largely depends on the qualifications and role of the teachers, which in turn are 23 evidenced by the academic attainments of students. Mindful of their noble mission in training engineers of human life, the teachers at medical schools and other educational institutions in the public health sector should direct every effort to raising the education they offer to the highest possible level, as required by our socialist healthcare system and our Party’s people-oriented policy on public health. These schools should provide effective basic and theoretical education so that their students, building on what they have learned, can acquire the latest medical scientific and technical information in their specialist field, and apply it in practice. They should step up the teaching of foreign languages so that students can, by reading literature and other materials from abroad, gain access to the latest medical science and technology and build up rich clinical experience through experiments and internships. A well-knit system of training nurses as well as doctors and pharmacists should be established so as to produce qualified nurses in a systematic way. The state management of and material support for public health are the cornerstone of the socialist public health service. 24 In our socialist healthcare system, based as it is on universal free medical care, its advantages and vitality cannot be fully displayed, nor can public health work develop, without proper state management and material, technical and financial support. Officials of the Cabinet, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Public Health, other ministries and national agencies concerned, as well as government organs in the provinces, cities and counties, should draw a lesson from their past misguided approach to their work and bring about a decisive improvement in the guidance and management of, and support for, public health work. The Cabinet should establish a rational system of state guidance and management over public health work and meet in full the demand for the medicines, medical equipment and materials, as well as funds, needed by the public health service. This will make it possible to achieve, in a short span of time, a major overall advance in the health service. Hospitals and other facilities in the public health sector need to be supplied with electricity, fuel and ambulances. The Cabinet, the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Public Health, while guiding and 25 managing the nationwide health service, should take direct charge of the public health service in the capital and major sectors and establish strict discipline for ensuring the planned and detailed supply of materials, technology and finance for them. Provincial, city and county government organs should improve their sense of responsibility and role in guiding regional public health services. Those in cities and counties in particular, by doing so, can build up and operate the hospitals and clinics in cities, counties and ri by their own efforts, and modernize medical treatment and prevention as suited to the local conditions. The senior and all other officials of our state economic guidance organs, public health organs and government organs at all levels should act responsibly and with complete commitment in carrying out the noble mission they have assumed for the public health service. In this way, they can give fuller play to the advantages and might of our socialist healthcare system and make the whole world envious of it. Improved Party guidance over public health work is essential for bringing about a revolutionary improvement in it. Only when Party organizations at all levels hold 26 fast to the Party’s policy on public health and encourage officials and the working people to carry it out, can they shore up the country’s public health work promptly and ensure that it makes rapid progress. Party organizations should all organize and wage an aggressive and dynamic organizational and political campaign to effect major innovations in public health work. They should bring the Party’s policy on public health home to the officials in this sector and the units concerned, and lead and inspire them to fully implement it. They should combine political and policy-oriented guidance properly in their leadership over the public health sector so that officials and the working people can display the high level of revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity needed for firmly defending and implementing the Party’s policy on public health; and if any deviation appears in its implementation, they should correct it promptly. Party organizations in the public health sector should ensure that public health workers display a high sense of organization with which they establish the spirit of taking part voluntarily and sincerely in 27 their organizational life and live and work under their organization’s guidance, and that they train themselves in a revolutionary manner through their organizational life. They should conduct ideological education among public health workers as suited to the features of their work. They should pay particularly close attention to educating all public health workers to display ardent love for their fellow humans and sincere devotion in treating the sick. At the same time, they should produce many able medical workers, famous doctors and doctors with specialist skills by directing great efforts to improving the scientific and technical qualifications of medical and other public health workers. Under the guidance of Party organizations, hospitals and other public health organs should place the main emphasis on, and subordinate everything to, medical treatment and prevention. To this end, Party organizations at all levels should strengthen Party-wide control and supervision to eradicate the practices of giving random social assignments to hospitals and other public health organs and seconding doctors, pharmacists and nurses 28 for projects that have nothing to do with medical treatment and prevention. Officials of the Party, of state economic organs and of the public health sector should hold fast to and carry out the Party’s policy on public health with a revolutionary faith and conscience. In this way they can defend the socialist healthcare system of our people-centred country that was built by Comrade Kim Il Sung, and add eternal brilliance to its advantages and might as required by the times, the revolution and the building of a powerful nation.",decisive improvement need public health service public health service since purpose safeguard life health important feature centre

13.10.2011,Kim Jong Il,"I express my thanks to ITAR-Tass for the written questions they have put to me concerning my successful visit to the Siberian and Far East regions of the Russian Federation. You have asked several questions and I shall answer them by groups for the sake of convenience. First, I would like to refer to my impressions of my Russia visit and the prospects for the development of DPRK-Russia relations. I am very glad to have visited our friendly neighbour Russia in August and met President Dmitri Anatoliyevich Medvedev. I cannot forget the fact that President Medvedev travelled thousands of kilometres to Ulan-Ude from the capital of Moscow to welcome us, nor can I forget the warm hospitality that officials from Moscow and the local areas and the Russian people accorded us everywhere we visited. And I recall with great pleasure the days early in the new century when I met former President Vladimir Putin on several occasions and deepened our friendship. I was deeply moved when I returned after nearly a decade to the Far East and Siberian regions visited previously by the great President Kim Il Sung who established the priceless traditions of the DPRK-Russia friendship and made an undying contribution to strengthening and developing them. During our third visit to Russia in the new century we looked round the Bureya Hydropower Station, a giant power producer in the Russian Far East, Lake Baikal, a scenic attraction in Siberia, and various cities and economic and cultural facilities. In the course of this we saw for ourselves and were deeply moved by the successes the Russian government and people were recording in building a powerful state, and 1 gained a better understanding of the thoughts, feelings and customs of the brave and diligent Russian people. The continued development of the history and traditions of the DPRK-Russia friendship accords fully with the interests of the peoples of our two countries and is a key to defending peace and stability in Northeast Asia. The DPRK-Russia summit and other talks held in Ulan-Ude were an important occasion for further expanding and developing the traditional relations of bilateral friendship and cooperation in line with the aspirations and wishes of the peoples of the two countries. At the summit and other talks we reached the mutual understanding that the development of bilateral economic relations in different fields, including the laying of a gas pipeline and the linking of railways, accords with the interests of the peoples of the two countries and will do much for regional prosperity. Accordingly, the two countries are now energetically pushing ahead with our practical efforts to develop cooperation in the energy sector, including the laying of the gas pipeline. I am confident that the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries will be further expanded and cemented in all fields–politics, the economy, culture and military affairs–on the basis of the agreements reached at the recent summit and other talks and of the spirit of the DPRK-Russia Joint Declaration, the DPRK-Russia Moscow Declaration and the DPRK-Russia Treaty of Friendship, Good-Neighbourliness and Cooperation. The government of our Republic values the traditional DPRK-Russia friendship highly and will make joint efforts with its Russian counterpart for the steady consolidation and development of the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries and two peoples. Next, I would like to speak about the nuclear issue on the 2 Korean peninsula and the resumption of the six-party talks. That the whole Korean peninsula should be nuclear-free was the behest of the great President Kim Il Sung, and it is the consistent stand of the government of our Republic. The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula arose as a result of the United States constantly threatening the sovereignty and security of our people. Sovereignty is the lifeblood of a country and nation. We have acquired a nuclear deterrent in order to protect our sovereignty in the face of the blatant nuclear threat from the United States and its increasingly hostile policy. As we agreed at the recent summit, there is no change in our principled stand, which is to strive to make the whole Korean peninsula nuclear-free by resuming the six-party talks as early as possible with no strings attached and implementing the September 19 Joint Statement fully and in a balanced way on the principle of simultaneous action. We will continue to work with the Russian side to oppose high-handed and arbitrary practices in the international arena, establish a fair international order and defend peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. As for the prospect of normalizing relations between our country and the United States and Japan, it depends entirely on the standpoint and attitude of the United States and Japan. It is a consistent foreign policy of our Republic to develop good relations with all the countries that are friendly to it, in conformity with the principles of independence, peace and friendship. In the new century, too, as it did in the past, the United States is persistently pursuing policy that is hostile to the DPRK; it continues to step up its pressure on the DPRK and by doing so is driving the situation to crisis point. 3 As the history of antagonism between the DPRK and the US shows, any act of hostility by the US and any moves towards invasion and disintegration will cut no ice with us and are doomed to failure. If the US, though belatedly, abandons its hostile policy towards the DPRK and approaches us in good faith, we are willing to improve bilateral relations. The primary issue in promoting relations between our country and Japan is for Japan to atone for the past crimes it committed against our country and people. If Japan takes a resolute step towards redressing its dubious past and abandoning its hostile policy, this may make it possible to normalize bilateral relations. Our Russian friends are showing a keen interest in the epochal progress our people are making in their efforts to build a thriving country. During my visit to Russia, President Medvedev conveyed his kind greetings to our people; he acknowledged the devoted efforts they are making to bring about fresh progress in their efforts to build a thriving country to mark the centenary of the birth of President Kim Il Sung, and he expressed his support for the positive measures we have taken to develop the country’s economy and improve the people’s standard of living. He also referred to his conviction that our people will achieve renewed success in their drive to build a prosperous and powerful country. All this serves as a great encouragement to our cause. Today our people are fully committed to implementing the cause of building a prosperous and powerful socialist country, which was the life-long wish of President Kim Il Sung; in particular, they are directing their efforts at improving their standard of living. We will without fail achieve brilliant success in the cause of 4 building a thriving nation on the strength of the single-hearted unity of the Party, army and people, and the sound potential of our independent national economy. It is my greatest wish to enable our people at the earliest possible date to live with nothing to envy, and it is my greatest pleasure to work energetically, sharing joy and sorrow with our people, as we work towards translating my wish into reality. I would like to take this opportunity to extend once again my friendly greetings to the Russian government and people and wish them great success in their efforts to build a powerful state",express thank itar tass write question put concern successful visit siberian far east region russian federation ask several question answer group sake convenience first refer impression russia visit prospect dprk russia relation glad visit friendly neighbour russia august meet dmitri anatoliyevich medvedev forget fact medvedev travel thousand kilometre ulan ude capital moscow welcome nor forget warm hospitality official moscow local area russian accord everywhere visit recall pleasure day early new century meet former vladimir putin several occasion deepen friendship deeply move return nearly decade far east siberian region visit previously sing establish priceless tradition dprk russia friendship undying contribution strengthen develop during third visit russia new century round bureya hydropower station giant power producer russian far east lake baikal scenic attraction siberia various city cultural facility course see ourselves be deeply move success russian government be record build gain well understanding thought feeling custom brave diligent russian continued history tradition dprk russia friendship accord fully interest people country key defend peace stability northeast asia dprk russia summit talk hold ulan ude be important occasion far expand develop traditional relation bilateral friendship cooperation aspiration wish people country summit talk reach mutual understanding bilateral relation different field include laying gas pipeline linking railway accord interest people country regional prosperity accordingly country now energetically push ahead practical effort cooperation energy include laying gas pipeline confident friendly cooperative relation country far expand cement field politic economy culture military affair basis agreement reach recent summit talk spirit dprk russia joint declaration dprk russia moscow declaration dprk russia treaty friendship neighbourliness cooperation government republic value traditional dprk russia friendship highly joint effort russian counterpart steady consolidation friendly cooperative relation country people next speak nuclear issue peninsula resumption six party talk peninsula nuclear free behest sung consistent stand government republic nuclear issue peninsula arise result united states constantly threaten sovereignty security sovereignty lifeblood nation acquire nuclear deterrent order protect sovereignty face blatant nuclear threat united states increasingly hostile agree recent summit there change principled stand strive peninsula nuclear free resume six party talk early possible string attach implement september joint statement fully balanced principle simultaneous action continue russian side oppose handed arbitrary practice international arena establish fair international order defend peace security asia rest prospect normalizing relation united states japan depend entirely standpoint attitude united states japan consistent foreign republic relation country friendly conformity principle independence peace friendship new century too past united states persistently pursue hostile dprk continue step pressure dprk do drive situation crisis point history antagonism dprk show act hostility move invasion disintegration cut ice doom failure belatedly abandon hostile dprk approach faith willing bilateral relation primary issue promote relation japan japan atone past crime commit japan take resolute step redress dubious past abandon hostile possible normalize bilateral relation russian friend show keen interest epochal progress make effort thriving during visit russia medvedev convey kind greeting acknowledge devoted effort make bring fresh progress effort thrive mark centenary birth sung express support positive measure take economy standard living refer conviction achieve renew success drive prosperous serve encouragement today fully commit implement build prosperous socialist life long wish sung particular direct effort improve standard living fail achieve brilliant success build thriving nation strength single hearted party army sound potential independent economy great wish enable early possible date live nothing envy great pleasure energetically share joy sorrow translate wish into reality opportunity extend once again friendly greeting russian government wish success effort
15.04.2012,Kim Jong-un,"Heroic officers of the army, the navy, the air force and the strategic rocket unit of the Korean People’s Army (KPA), and officers of the Korean People’s Internal Security Forces; members of the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and the Young Red Guards; working people of the entire country and citizens of Pyongyang; the people in the South and overseas compatriots; comrades and friends, Today, we proceed with a grand military parade to celebrate the 100th birth anniversary of great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung, while embracing the greatest national pride and self-esteem. Today’s military parade, which is unprecedented in the history of the founding of the army, is a grand festival of the winner that has been prepared based on great Comrade Kim Jong Il’s noble intention and direct suggestion to forever glorify Comrade Kim Il Sung’s immortal achievement of building the military and let the whole world know about the splendor of the socialist powerful state. On this meaningful occasion, I express the noblest respect and the greatest honor to great Comrade Kim Il Sung, who is the founder and the builder of the revolutionary armed forces and the banner of ever-victoriousness, and to Comrade Kim Jong Il, with the heart of endless admiration by all of the officers of the people’s army and the people. And I express my respect to the anti-Japanese revolutionary patriotic martyrs and the people’s army patriotic martyrs, who sacrificed their invaluable lives for the fatherland’s independence and the people’s liberation. I passionately congratulate the officers of our people’s army and the officers of the People’s Internal Security Forces, members of the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and the Young Red Guards, and all the people, who glorified this year’s meaningful holidays with strengthened fighting power and proud achievements of the revolutionary great upswing by displaying matchless heroism and dedication at every sentry post on the 1,000-ri defense line and every battle field of building a powerful state in the fatherland. Moreover, I convey warm greetings to compatriots in the South and overseas compatriots, who are dedicating everything to the patriotic cause of the reunification, wealth, power, and prosperity of the fatherland. I express gratitude to foreign friends, who are extending their positive support to the just cause of our people. Comrades, the great 100-year history of the Kim Il Sung nation is a history that proves the iron truth that dignity and great prosperity of a country and nation exist only when an excellent leader is served. While prided itself on a 5,000-year-old long history and brilliant culture, because it was not under correct leadership and lacked the power to defend itself, the very appearance of our nation a century ago was a small and weak, pitiful colonial nation that had to endure flunkeyism and national ruin as its fate. However, the 100-year history of the Kim Il Sung nation put a permanent end to the stormy history of suffering, and lifted the dignity of our country and people to the highest state in the history of the nation. Then or now, there is no change in the geopolitical position of the nation, but the small and weak nation of yesterday – which had been mercilessly trampled upon at each festival scene of the powers – has today changed into a dignified political and military power and our people are displaying dignity as independent people who can never be toyed with by anybody. This phenomenal event that has taken place in the destiny of our nation is no accident brought about by time, but an inevitable history brought about by great Comrade Kim Il Sung and Comrade Kim Jong Il, who are the pioneers and leaders of the military-first revolution. It was for serving the extraordinary great men — w ho built the most elite revolutionary strong army while putting forward of attaching importance to the gun barrel as the basis of revolution — that a fundamental turnabout was brought about in the destiny of our fatherland and people, and that today’s grand festival site displaying the national power of military-first Korea have also been staged magnificently. Great Comrade Kim Il Sung early on elucidated the philosophical principle that the gun barrel is the life of the nation and also victory of the revolution, and founded the Korean People’s Revolutionary Army — which is the first revolutionary armed forces of chuch’e-style — with brilliant sons and daughters of the people in the forest of Paektu, 80 years ago from now. With the founding of the Korean People’s Revolutionary Army, our people came to have a true army of their own for the first time in history, and the honorable history of the Korean Revolution which advances through the might of the gun barrel started from this. Comrade Kim Il Sung — who paid foremost attention to strengthening the revolutionary armed forces throughout the entire period of the long revolutionary activities — performed the military miracle of the 20th century of defeating the two most outrageous imperialisms in one generation, and prepared a powerful military guarantee for sovereignty of the country and prosperity of the nation for all ages by raising the people’s army into a revolutionary strong army of one-a-matchfor-a hundred, and arming all the people and fortifying the whole land. Great Comrade Kim Jong Il — who put forward inheriting and completing the military-first revolutionary cause of chuch’e pioneered by Comrade Kim Il Sung as his lifelong mission — opened the highest stage of the development of our revolutionary armed forces with his extraordinary sagacity, outstanding art of command, and matchless pluck. During the period of the gravest ordeal for our revolution, Comrade Kim Jong Il strengthened! and developed the people’s army into the most elite combat ranks, led to constant victories, the unprecedented battles to protect socialism, and achieved the great historic feats of enhancing our country to the status of a world-class militarily powerful state through the ever-victorious military-first politics. Under the care of great Comrade Kim Il Sung and Comrade Kim Jong Il, our revolutionary armed forces have displayed in full, the majestic appearance as the revolutionary strong army with clear revolutionary character and infinitely strong military temperament and might. On the path of proud struggles on which our revolutionary armed forces have walked were grand construction battles to consolidate an everlasting foundation for the prosperous and powerful fatherland as well as grave life-and-death decisive battles against powerful imperialists. In those days, our revolutionary armed forces were infinitely loyal to their foremost mission as the true army of the leader and true army of the party and brilliantly answered the expectations of the fatherland and the people. The noble spirit of death-defying defense of the leader — which was created by antiJapanese guerrillas — has served as the absolute motto and fundamental source of spiritual strength and combat s! trength of our army, and has become a noble tradition that has been passed on from generation to generation. Holding aloft the banner of death-defying defense of the leader before everything else and resolutely defending the lifeline of the chuch’e revolution at the forefront in days of honor and in days of ordeal as well is the greatest exploit of all the exploits that our people’s army has made before the revolution. The history of our army — which started from two pistols and has grown into the matchless powerful army that makes the imperialist aggressors shiver — is unprecedented in the world’s history of military development. During the long period from its founding until today, ou r people’s army has come to have the almighty chuch’e-based art of war and the experience of winning constant victories in the process of waging guerilla warfare and regular warfare and confrontational wars without the sounds of gunshots and the roars of cannons, and grown into an infinitely powerful strong army fully equipped with means of attack and means of defense of our style with which it is fully capable of responding to any modern warfare. Military technological supremacy is not a monopoly of imperialists any more, and the time has gone forever when the enemies threatened and intimidated us with atomic bombs. Today’s solemn military demonstration will clearly confirm this. Our people’s army has left clear traces also in the construction of a prosperous and powerful fatherland, not only as a defender of the fatherland, but also as a creator of the people’s happiness since it engraved the word people in its name. The invaluable blood and sweat of our people’s army officers and men have penetrated into the monumental creations that have risen up at every nook and corner of the fatherland and the numerous socialist assets that contribute to the people’s living standards. The revolutionary strong army of Mt Paektu — which has high pride and displays the majestic invincible, ever-victorious appearance as the army of the leader, the party, and the people — is truly the greatest patriotic legacy left by the great generalissimos, and it is the great luck and pride of our party and people to have inherited such a noble legacy. Because the history of hundred victories that the heroic KPA has been engraving exists, the glorious 100-year history of chuch’e Korea exists and the ten million year-history of the Kim Il Sung nation and Kim Jong Il Korea is firmly guaranteed. The sacred revolutionary chronicles and immortal achievements of great Comrade Kim Il Sung and Comrade Kim Jong Il — who, while making their way through the thorny new road of the military-first revolution, opened up a new era of national independence and prepared a strong foundation that guarantees the great prosperity of the country and the happiness of all the generations to come — will shine forever in the history of the fatherland. Comrades, today we are standing at the watershed of history, when a new chuch’e century begins. More than any other time, this is precisely a responsible and important period when we who have learned the revolution under the care of Comrade Kim Jong Il must set out resolutely to make strenuous efforts. At the historic fourth Party Representatives Conference and the fifth session of the 12th Supreme People’s Assembly that took place a few days ago, great Comrade Kim Jong Il was held in high esteem as the eternal leader of our revolution, as the eternal general secretary of the Workers Party of Korea, and as the eternal chairman of the National Defense Commission of our Republic. This is an indication of the steadfast will of our party, army, and people to inherit and complete to the end the chuch’e revolutionary cause, which was pioneered at Paektu, without an inch of deflection or a step of concession, only in the style of our leader and general, under the uplifted banner of the great Kimilsungism and Kimjongilism. The farsighted strategy of our revolution and ultimate victory lie here in directly proceeding along the path of independence, the path of military-first, and the path of socialism unfolded by the great Comrade Kim Il Sung and Comrade Kim Jong Il. In order for us to eternally glorify the dignity of military-first Korea and successfully accomplish the cause of building a powerful socialist state, first, second, and third, we must strengthen the people’s army in every way. The people’s army must in the future as well, become a reliable reconnaissance party of the military-first revolution, an unyielding point of support that steadfastly guarantees the cause of the party with the gun barrel, while plowing through snowy paths at the forefront, following the guidance of the party. Things that cannot change even with the passing of time and the overturning of tens of hundreds of generations are the revolutionary characteristics of our people’s army, who took after our leader and general, and the struggle method of the Mt Paektu revolutionary strong army, which is advancing forward holding high the red flag of the WPK as the first battle flag. In line with the demands of the development of reality, should further intensify the movement to win the title of the O Chung-hu’p Seventh Regiment, and turn the entire army into today’s version of the seventh Regiment, that is completely filled with the anti-Japanese guns-and-bombs spirit. The people’s army should become an ideological purity and organizational integral whole, which join its ideas, breaths, and footsteps with the party, by thoroughly embodying the chuch’eoriented military idea and line of our party in the military’s political work and by more firmly establishing the revolutionary leadership system. By more fiercely raising the hot wind of Paektu training in the entire army, we should strongly prepare all people’s army officers and men as full-blooded fighters who have mastered the evervictorious strategies and tactics of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, transformative attack methods, and thorough practical capabilities, and we should further equip ourselves with regularized aspects of the most elite revolutionary strong army, who are gallant within and without, with strong discipline. The invincible unity of the entire army strongly united around the party as one comrade-in-arms and the millions of soldiers and people forming a harmonious whole is the true might of our people’s army, and here lies the basic key to the reinforcement of military power. Holding high the slogan Let the entire army become true comrades-in-arms, the people’s army should make the traditional virtue of the unity between officers and men flower more brilliantly, and the entire army should become a comrades-in-arms unit which shares blood and life on the single path of the military-first revolution. Commanders and soldiers are all equally valuable comrades-in-arms of the supreme commander. What we trust is not rockets or any other modern arms and equipment, but our loving soldiers. Commanders exist for the soldiers, and the supreme commander also exists for the soldiers. All commanders should adopt as their inveterate traits, heartily taking care of the soldiers with the feelings of an elder brother, elder sister, or true comrade-in-arms, and running again and again for the soldiers until their shoes wear out. Army-people unity is the root of our society and the greatest foundation of the military-first revolution. The people’s army must take the lead and be a forerunner all the time also in consolidating great unity between the army and the people as firm as a rock, succeeding to the tradition of the anti-Japanese partisans. Our people’s army must continue to advance, upholding the slogan, let us help the people, presented by the great general. The officers and men of the people’s army must fulfill their duty as the army of the people by doing more good deeds for the people, as if they were caring for their own parents and brothers and as if managing their own home gardens. It is our party’s resolute determination to let our people who are the best in the world — our people who have overcome all obstacles and ordeals to uphold the party faithfully — not tighten their belts again and enjoy the wealth and prosperity of socialism as much as they like. We must well grow the valuable seeds, which the great Comrade Kim Jong Il sowed to build an economically powerful state and improve the people’s liveli hood, and lead them to bloom as a glorious reality. The addition of the industrial revolution of the new century to single-hearted unity and invincible military power makes none other than a powerful socialist state. We will have to embark on the comprehensive construction of an economically powerful state by kindling more fiercely, the flames of the industrial revolution of the new century and the flames of South Hamgyong Province. The officers and men of the people’s army must make a breakthrough in the march of great upswing, continuously demonstrating the might of the revolutionary strong army, which knows no impossibility, at every major battle area for the construction of an economically powerful state and the improvement of the people’s livelihood. All the functionaries, party members, and working people must follow the struggle trait and creative characteristics of the people’s army, which finishes at a breath what it decides to undertake, and fiercely stir up the hot wind of great innovations and great leap that survive the ages at all the fronts of socialist construction. For our party and the Republic’s government that consider powerful state construction and people’s livelihood improvement to be their general goal, peace cannot be more valuable. However, for us, the nation’s dignity and the country’s sovereignty are more valuable. To safeguard the dignity and sovereignty of our Republic like an iron wall and defend true peace and the country’s security, all the officers and men of the people’s army must firmly guarantee with the gun barrel, our party’s cause of building a powerful state at a full combat mobilization posture without losing their revolutionary true character any time. It is truly heartbreaking that our brethren are suffering the agony of division for nearly 70 years after living for a long time as a single nation in the same land. Our party and the Republic’s government will go hand in hand with anyone who truly desires the country’s reunification and the nation’s peaceful prosperity and will make responsible and patient efforts to accomplish the historic cause of the fatherland’s reunification. Comrades. Our cause is just and the might of Korea that is united with truth is infinite. We will surely win as the great Comrade Kim Il Sung and Comrade Kim Jong Il, who are eternally living in the hearts of all the officers and men of the people’s army and all the people of the country, are blessing our bright future; as we have the matchless Mt Paektu revolutionary strong army and the invincible great unity between the army and the people; and as long as there are the faithful people who uphold the cause of the party with conscience and loyalty . I will be a comrade-in-arms who always shares life and death and destiny with comrades on the road of the sacred military-first revolution and will fulfill my responsibility for the fatherland and revolution by upholding Comrade Kim Jong Il’s behest. Let us all unite firmly and fight powerfully with one mind and with one accord, as befitting the descendents of the great leader and as befitting the warriors and disciples of the great general. The sun flag of the great Comrade Kim Il Sung and Comrade Kim Jong Il will forever flutter in the van of our revolutionary ranks that display only victory and honor and will always encourage and drive us toward a new victory. Move forward toward the final victory.",heroic officer army navy air force strategic rocket unit army kpa officer internal security force member peasant red guard young red guard work entire citizen

26.07.2012,Kim Jong-un,"In our implementing of the cause of building a thriving socialist country today, it is very important to apply Kim Jong Il’s patriotism. I have already explained Kim Jong Il’s patriotism on several occasions. However, our officials still have a poor understanding of it, and they fail to substantially apply it to their practical activities with proper methodology. We emphasize Kim Jong Il’s patriotism to encourage officials, Party members and other working people not to merely shout it as a slogan or to hold it up like a banner, but to learn from the ennobling examples of patriotism set by the great General Kim Jong Il and apply his patriotism thoroughly to their practical activities in building a thriving country. The General was a peerless patriot; he loved his country and fellow people more ardently than anybody else, and devoted his whole life to achieving the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people, thus performing imperishable exploits that are etched in the history of the country. Always cherished in the depth of his heart were his dear country and people. When he saw a forest thickly wooded or a vast field realigned in a sweeping manner, he would say to himself, “Green mountain” and “Green field,” picturing in his mind the future of a thriving country and the happiness our people would enjoy down through generations. When he was on visits to foreign countries, he would say with deep emotion, “My country, my nation,” missing his country and people back in his country. When he saw a poorlywooded mountain on his field guidance trip, he would feel painful and say that our country had been called a three-thousand-ri land of golden tapestry from time immemorial, adding that we should turn it into a land of golden tapestry of the era of the Workers’ Party and hand it over to the coming generations. When he saw that the service personnel of army units had planted many trees on the mountains around their barracks and tended them well, he would speak highly of their patriotism and call theirs units of patriots. And when he saw a village and the barracks of an army unit which were well laid out and covered with apricot and persimmon trees, he called them an apricot-tree village and a persimmon-tree company, respectively, adding national fragrance to their names. Being determined to be the master of the revolution in Korea from the first day of embarking on the road of the revolution, he defended and added brilliance to his socialist country by devoting his all throughout his life, and continued to follow the road of love for his country and people until the last moment of his life. The struggle to defend the socialist country was the acutest showdown with the imperialist allied forces, the severest struggle unprecedented in its history. To break through the harsh trials facing the country and defend it, the General set out on the long, arduous road of Songun-based leadership in a do-or-die spirit. The only parka he wore from the days of the “Arduous March” to the last days of his life is vivid evidence showing what a thorny path he had to traverse with patriotic devotion to defend his socialist country. One year, looking back on the days of the trying ordeals with deep emotion, he touched on the parka he was wearing. He said that he wore it at the onset of the “Arduous March” after President Kim Il Sung had passed away, and that he kept wearing it because he could not forget the trials. He continued earnestly that the parka was symbolic of the Songun-based revolution. Even a parka gets thin if one wears it long, and it cannot keep one warm in the cold. Though icy wind got through the old parka, he burned his heart with a sense of responsibility for the defence of his country. He held on to the parka for more than ten years, when he displayed strong will and superhuman energy going on with his inspection of the military units on the front line to train the soldiers into a-match-for-ahundred combatants. Chol Pass and Mt. Osong he climbed braving howling snowstorms, Cho Islet he visited across a rough sea, and other frontline posts will remain witnesses to the patriotic devotion he displayed on the road of Songun-based leadership to defend the country. As can be seen through the recent parade held to mark the centenary of the birth of the President, our country, which was robbed of its sovereignty a century ago because of its weak military strength, is demonstrating its dignity as a world-class military power; it owes its matchless military might to the wise leadership of the General. Whenever we reflect on the road of Songun-based leadership the General followed shouldering the responsibility for the destiny of his country and nation, we deeply realize what valuable and ennobling patriotism he possessed in defending our country, our motherland. The thorny path he covered all his life with a single mind of patriotic devotion led to the transformation of our country’s appearance and the laying of the solid cornerstone for building a prosperous and powerful nation. Even in the grim period of leading the struggle in defence of socialism, he unfolded a farreaching plan of building a thriving socialist country and wisely led the efforts for its implementation. Under his energetic leadership the land all over the country was realigned as befits a socialist country, gravitational waterways built in many regions and rural villages turned into socialist fairylands. What is more, modern heavy- and light-industry factories were built in large numbers, existing factories renovated to meet the demands of the new century and monumental structures that would contribute to the country’s prosperity and the well-being of all generations to come built in an excellent way in various parts of the country. The introduction of CNC technology that effected an industrial revolution of our style in the new century shows us the high level of his patriotism. Still vivid in my memory is his image in January 2010, when he recollected with deep emotion how he earnestly explained the details of CNC technology to the officials who had not had a correct understanding of the technology so as to stoke the flames of introducing the technology. During the period when the country was undergoing difficulties he had precious funds allocated for the introduction of CNC technology for the prosperous future of the country although he was haunted by the thoughts of the people who were suffering from food shortage. That he decided shedding his heart’s tears to spend the precious funds, which could be called all in the coffers of the state, for the introduction of CNC technology was a courageous decision and the best choice born of his patriotic will to raise the international profile of his country, his motherland, by fostering its might, not by importing others’ showy machines. Patriotism finds its highest expression in fostering the might of one’s country for its prosperity. Strong national might makes it possible to defend the country and guarantees the happiness of all generations to come. Whenever he heard the song Break through the Cutting Edge, he would shed tears recollecting the arduous road he had traversed and mental difficulties he had surmounted for the introduction of CNC technology. Indeed, his tears were tears of ardent patriotism. The epochal changes effected in our country and the proud realities unfolded in the prospering Songun Korea are all valuable fruits born of his ennobling patriotism. His burning love for his socialist country and people and his self-sacrificing devotion to the prosperity of the country and happiness of the people originated from his absolute trust in his people and unbreakable confidence in the justness of the socialist system and the victory of the socialist cause. There can be no love and devotion separated from trust and confidence. It is only from unshakable trust and confidence that genuine and warm love and unstinting devotion are produced. Saying that there is no people in the world better than ours, he always placed absolute trust in them. And saying, “Let’s see who laughs last,” he had firm confidence in the victorious future of the country. As he firmly trusted in our people and the victorious future of the country as in himself, he was always on the road of devotion for the country and people with the most ardent love for them. His warm love and devotion for the country and people also originated from his ennobling sense of mission. He cherished the ennobling sense of duty and mission that he was responsible for the destiny of the country and people the President had entrusted to him. Out of this sense he set out on the long march of Songun-based leadership with a do-or-die determination and devoted his all to the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people with the most ardent love for them. In the light of its essential content and great vitality, the patriotism he cherished and applied in his practical activities is the most ennobling patriotism which can be associated only with his name. For this reason, when I speak of patriotism, I mean not patriotism in general, but Kim Jong Il’s patriotism, the patriotism that he cherished and applied to defend his country and make it prosperous. Kim Jong Il’s patriotism is the crystallization of socialist patriotism. It is the most fervent and the warmest love for our socialist country and people and the most earnest and self-sacrificing devotion to the prosperity of the country and the well-being of the people. It is genuine patriotism that holds dear every tree and every blade of grass of the country and devotes one’s heart and soul to looking after them. Kim Jong Il’s patriotism is based on the ennobling view of the motherland. Kim Jong Il wrote in The Embrace of My Motherland, a classic song that he created in his early years, that the embrace of the country whose land glows under the sun radiant is the embrace of Kim Il Sung, thus presenting a profound idea that to our people the motherland is immediately their leader and the embrace of their motherland is his embrace. One’s motherland is not simply a place where one was born and grew up; it must be a place which guarantees genuine life for the people and eternal happiness for posterity, which in turn is assured by the leader. The genuine life for the people and eternal happiness for posterity can be created and brought into bloom only by the leader who loves the country and the people in real earnest and devotes his all to them. The destiny of the country and people cannot be thinkable separated from their leader, and it can be defended and guaranteed only by him. Hence, devotion to the country is precisely faithfulness to the leader, and faithfulness to the leader is a display of patriotism, the highest expression of patriotism. Kim Jong Il’s patriotism is based on the noble outlook on people that believes in them as in heaven. “The people are my God” was the General’s motto throughout his life. He said that if there is an omnipotent entity in this world, it is the masses, not the God; it was his creed of patriotism that the country exists as there exist the people. His patriotic mind was always filled with the word people. If it is the wish of the people, I should pluck a star out of the heavens or grow flowers even on a rock–it was the noble meaning of his affection for people and his will. Even now, whenever I listen to the Song of Affection for People, singing that the sum of the General’s lifelong exploits, as wide as the sea and as high as the sky, is that only for people, I cannot help shedding tears as I recall the benevolent image of the General who valued people all his life. For the ennobling view of the younger generation, Kim Jong Il’s patriotism stokes our feelings further. The slogan “Let us live not merely for today but for tomorrow!” is the intensification of his view of the younger generation. Whatever we do, we must do it most creditably and perfectly so that the coming generation can enjoy benefit from it even in the distant future although we may not enjoy it in our lifetime–this was his ennobling intention and an earnest request he always made. Kim Jong Il’s patriotism is, indeed, a precious spiritual legacy he left for our people and an example to follow in practice. It is a valuable ideological and spiritual sustenance indispensable to all who love their country and fellow people; it also provides those struggling for the sake of their country and fellow people with a powerful motive force that infuses into them courage and vigour. It will serve as a bright beacon in bringing up our people to be genuine patriots through generations, and as a compass to guide them in their struggle and life. All our officials, Party members and other working people should learn positively from the ennobling patriotism of the General who devoted tireless efforts to the country and people all his life, burning his heart with ardent love for them, and apply it in practice as it is, without adding anything to it or deducting anything from it. Education for implanting Kim Jong Il’s patriotism deep in the hearts of the people should be strengthened. We should strengthen education in Kim Jong Il’s patriotism to encourage all Party members, working people, service personnel and youth and students to understand its true meaning and cherish it in their hearts. Education in Kim Jong Il’s patriotism should be carried on in depth and breadth through theoretical explanation. This type of education should not be conducted in the way of shouting slogans, but in depth and breadth combined with theoretical explanation to inspire all Party members and other working people to have a clear understanding of the General’s view of the country, of the people and of the younger generation, and become genuine patriots who render loyal services to their country and people like the General and devote their blood and sweat of patriotism for tomorrow, when their desire would burst into bloom, though it is hard today like the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners who had fought, dedicating their youth and life, for the future of their country and people. Education in Kim Jong Il’s patriotism should be conducted substantially in combination with practice. The main mistake in the current education in patriotism is that the education is conducted far removed from practice. Education separated from practice is to no avail. Patriotism is wholehearted devotion to the country and people. Stressing that anxiety for the country does not mean patriotism and patriotism only in word is unwanted, the General said that if one is ready for patriotism, one should perform patriotic deeds with a true spirit of patriotism. The spirit of patriotism should be expressed in practical activities designed for the well-being of the country and people. To the call of the country and people, one should not answer in mere words, but by dedicating one’s whole being; this is the proper stance of a patriot. Those who follow the road of genuine patriotism without hesitation or vacillation in any adversity, those who faithfully carry out in time and to the letter the revolutionary tasks the country and people have assigned them, are genuine patriots. Education in Kim Jong Il’s patriotism should be based on reality and conducted in keeping with the specific situations. Patriotism is not an abstract concept. It begins from one’s own home. It buds out from the love for one’s parents, spouses and children, the love for one’s own home, village and workplace, and further develops into the love for one’s country and fellow people. Those who do not cherish affection for their parents, spouses and children and for their homes, villages and workplaces cannot love their country and fellow people; they can never become genuine patriots. We should educate all Party members and other working people to become genuine patriots who first love their parents, spouses and children and further sincerely shed sweat and dedicate their all to spruce up their homes, villages and workplaces so that they are better than others’ and add lustre to their country, their motherland. We should be effective in applying Kim Jong Il’s patriotism in the practical activities. To apply Kim Jong Il’s patriotism means to thoroughly materialize the General’s intentions and desires for the prosperity of the country and the happiness of all generations to come and to carry on all work for achieving the prosperity of the country in the way he did. We should faithfully carry to completion the undertakings he planned and was carrying on in his lifetime, so that his ideals and desires are translated into reality on this land. The highest expression of patriotism is found in defending the motherland. Where there is the motherland, there exist our Party, our government, our socialist system and the happy life of our people. The life dedicated to national defence is the most valuable, patriotic life. The service personnel of the People’s Army who are standing in the forefront of national defence should firmly grasp the weapons of the revolution, and reliably defend the outposts of the country; the people in the home front should support their country of Songun through sincere aid to the service personnel. All the people should attach importance to military affairs and learn them in earnest. Should the enemy attack, they should make a resolute counterattack and give play to their patriotism in the sacred war for national defence. All officials, Party members and other working people should cherish Kim Jong Il’s patriotism deep in their minds and turn out in the effort for achieving the prosperity of their country, their motherland. The effort for achieving the prosperity of the country is a worthwhile struggle to materialize our people’s centuries-old desire and a sacred patriotic struggle to implement the instructions of President Kim Il Sung and GeneralKim Jong Il. We should become genuine patriots in the era of Songun and build a thriving socialist country for others to see, like the generation who built a new, democratic Korea shortly after its liberation, upholding the patriotic appeal of Kim Il Sung and like the heroes in the era of Chollima who built a people’s paradise with empty hands on the debris in the post-war days. For our nation that has suffered long from indescribable misfortune and pain, divided into the north and south by outside forces, national reunification is the supreme national task, which brooks no further delay. National reunification is patriotism pure and simple, and national division is treachery to the nation. Those who sincerely love their country and nation, whether they live in the north, in the south or abroad, should valiantly turn out in the righteous struggle for reunifying the country, true to the noble idea of loving the country and nation cherished by Kim Jong Il, a peerless patriot. Patriotism can be likened to a gemstone. As a gemstone keeps sparkling even under the ground, the idea of loving the country, however small it may be, is valuable and always beautiful. We should cherish patriotism as valuable and beautiful as a gemstone, and volunteer to do the undertakings helpful to achieving the prosperity of the country and the well-being of the people. Always reflecting ourselves on the question about what we have devoted to the good of the country and people, we should cultivate the idea of loving the country. Only then will we be able to display genuine patriotism when planting even a tree and shed sweat out of patriotism when digging up a spadeful of earth in a construction site. Party and working people’s organizations should fulfil their responsibility and role in the efforts to learn from Kim Jong Il’s patriotism and apply it in the practical activities. It is often said that Party work is work with people, but, as a matter of fact, it fails to inspire and enlist the patriotism cherished in the minds of the people. Both Party work and the work of working people’s organizations are work with people and for the country and people, so they should be naturally geared to cultivating and giving play to the patriotism cherished by the people. Today many of our Party members and other working people serve their country and people faithfully at their own posts whether or not they are seen or appreciated. They are all genuine patriots. Party and working people’s organizations should value and appreciate the patriotic deeds performed by them, and raise the wind of patriotism throughout society so as to encourage everyone to take part in patriotic undertakings. All state organs and social organizations should pay attention to education in Kim Jong Il’s patriotism. In educating in and applying Kim Jong Il’s patriotism educational institutions have a special role to play; they should orient their teaching to the education in Kim Jong Il’s patriotism, and combine their education closely with family and social education. Officials should be exemplary in applying Kim Jong Il’s patriotism. They should not remain only worrying about their country; they should become genuine patriots who are ready to throw themselves into supporting the country. The slogan “We serve the country and the people!” presented by our Party is a slogan of patriotism our officials should hold high today. Officials should burn themselves with patriotic enthusiasm before anybody else, for the country and people, and shed sweat in the vanguard of the patriotic struggle of the people. When all officials work sincerely, devoting their all and sharing good times and bad with the people, sometimes carrying burdens on their backs, all people will take an active part in the building of a prosperous country with a sense of patriotism. Some days ago I said that we should do our work so that people give cheers for our Workers’ Party whenever and wherever they are. It means that we should do our work efficiently so that they do so voluntarily not only at the rallies but also when they are left alone on the far-flung islands or deep in the mountains. When our officials, who have to serve the people, make tireless efforts shedding sweat to make our country prosperous and provide people with an abundant life, people would give cheers for the Workers’ Party from the bottom of their hearts whenever and wherever they may be. Our Party demands that the whole country demonstrate enthusiasm for Kim Jong Il’s patriotism to the full so as to hasten the final victory of the building of a thriving socialist country with the surging might of patriotism and single-hearted unity. As the President opened up the path of building a new country after liberation by kindling the flames of patriotism with the historic speech on his triumphant return, the speech in which he appealed for the building of a new, democratic Korea, those with strength giving strength, those with knowledge offering knowledge and those with money donating money, and as the General overcame severe trials and opened the way to the building of a thriving socialist country by kindling the flames of patriotism with a letter in which he appealed to all people to work energetically and with one purpose to make our country, our motherland, ever more prosperous, our Party is going to set up a new milestone in the building of a thriving socialist country by stoking the flames of patriotism with Kim Jong Il’s patriotism as the starting fire. This is the unshakable will and determination of our Party. When the whole country brims over with Kim Jong Il’s patriotism and all the people apply it to the letter in their practical activities, our country will shine in the world as a thriving socialist

12.10.2012,Kim Jong-un,"Today we are marking the 65th anniversary of the founding of Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School. I warmly congratulate all the teaching staff, students and graduates of these revolutionary schools who are marking the 65th anniversary of the schools’ founding amidst the blessings of all the service personnel and people in the first year of the new century of the Juche era in Kim Il Sung’s and Kim Jong Il ’s Korea. Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School are revolutionary schools of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il founded and developed under the care of the great persons of Mt. Paektu, and are bases for training the backbone of the Songun revolution. Though he had much to do in building a new Korea in the liberated country, Generalissimo Kim Il Sung had a revolutionary school built in historic Mangyongdae for the sons and daughters of his comrades-in-arms who had died on the road of the revolution. Because he was endowed with a noble sense of revolutionary obligation and warm affection for the rising generations, he could make the bold decision to have the school built in the difficult days immediately after the liberation of the country, when he returned from Mt. Paektu with nothing but an empty knapsack. Our service personnel and people will never forget the legendary tales of the affection and benevolence bestowed by the fatherly leader on the sons and daughters of revolutionary martyrs until to the last days of his great career from the days when he went to the trouble of having the children, who had been wandering with nobody to support them, located one by one and 1 provided them with the shelter of a revolutionary school. Kim Jong Suk, the anti-Japanese heroine, was the benevolent mother of the students of the revolutionary school and a great teacher; she took maternal care of the sons and daughters of revolutionary martyrs and brought them up to be the successors to the revolution. The bronze statue of Generalissimo Kim Il Sung at Mangyongdae Revolutionary School–the first to be erected in our country–and the uniform of the school are associated with the great pains she took to bring up its students to be the pillars of the revolution, for whom loyalty to the leader was their life and soul. Generalissimo Kim Jong Il, having implanted in the minds of the students of Mangyongdae Revolutionary School, while studying with them, the faith with which to trust and follow only the leader, spared nothing to build up the school and Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School as bases for training the backbone of our revolution and as comfortable homes for their students. Everything at the schools, ranging from the beds to the rich food for the students, to say nothing of the modern educational equipment and rare biological specimens, embody his affection. Thanks to his benevolent embrace, even in the difficult days when the whole country was conducting the “Arduous March,” the revolutionary schools continued to operate and their students grew, learning and playing to their heart’s content with nothing to envy in the world, and becoming the pillars of the revolution that would carry the future of the country. Under the wise guidance and meticulous care of the great persons of Mt. Paektu, Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School have, over the past 65 years, brought up many people who have played core, pivotal roles in the sacred struggle for the defence and prosperity of the country. As we mark the 65th anniversary of the founding of the revolutionary schools today, I pay noblest tribute to the great 2 persons of Mt. Paektu, who had the schools built in the difficult and arduous days when a new country was being built and who for more than half a century brought up the sons and daughters of revolutionary martyrs to be the pillars of the country so that they could continue the lifeline, the bloodline, of the Songun revolution. In the effort to build a prosperous, powerful Paektusan nation on this land to be reunified true to the wishes of the great Generalissimos, Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School, the “pedigree farms” for training the backbone of the Songun revolution, have important responsibilities and tasks to perform. Their basic task today when the revolutionary cause of Juche is at a new, historic turning point, is to train all their students to be the pillars, the backbone, of the Songun revolution who will steadfastly carry forward the lineage of Mangyongdae, the lineage of Paektu. Just as rich harvests are expected only when pedigree farms produce fertile seeds, so the People’s Army, the reliable vanguard and solid cornerstone of the Songun revolution, will be consolidated and the country be more prosperous only when the revolutionary schools produce a powerful backbone for the Songun revolution. By adding lustre to the immortal leadership exploits of the Generalissimos associated with the schools and decisively improving their education and edification in line with the Party’s intentions and the requirements of the developing revolution, the schools should train their students to be a dependable backbone who will steadfastly carry forward the lifeline, the bloodline, of our revolution, to be vanguard fighters who will make breakthroughs on the general onward march to final victory armin-arm and shoulder-to-shoulder with the Supreme Commander. 3 In educating and edifying their students, the revolutionary schools should, first of all, intensify the ideological education. The children of a revolutionary do not grow up to be revolutionaries simply because they have inherited their parent’s lineage. As the great Generalissimos said, blood may be inherited, but not ideology. A revolutionary ideology can become a man’s article of faith and his guide in his struggle only through constant ideological education and a practical struggle. Their days at a revolutionary school are a very important time in the lives of the students, as the framework of their world outlook is established then, so the schools should further intensify the ideological education while giving priority to teaching politico-ideological subjects. The revolutionary schools should educate their students so that they make loyalty to the Party and the leader their life and soul. Maintaining loyalty to the Party and the leader as their life and soul is an obligation and duty for the sons and daughters of revolutionary martyrs. By giving their students constant education in the spirit of continuing the revolution by following in their parents’ footsteps, the revolutionary schools should ensure that they put absolute trust in the Party and the leader, staunchly safeguard their prestige and defend them even at the cost of their lives. The revolutionary schools should firmly equip their students with the tradition of loyalty, the spirit of defending the leader to the death. The spirit of defending the leader to the death is the most important ideological and spiritual trait for the sons and daughters of revolutionary martyrs. The history of our revolution, which has advanced 4 victoriously through grim trials and hardships, is adorned with the brilliant feats the Bodyguard Company, formed of students from Mangyongdae Revolutionary School, performed in defence of the leader during the Fatherland Liberation War by inheriting the tradition of the Guard Company in the days of the anti-Japanese war. By teaching their students to learn from the ennobling examples of their revolutionary forerunners in defending the leader to the death, Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School should ensure that they all become bodyguards of the Songun era who defend the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun and the Party Central Committee to the death, being aware that they are the sentinels of the Supreme Headquarters and holding high the banners bearing the smiling images of the great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. The revolutionary schools should intensify their education through revolutionary relics. Loyalty is encouraged not through words but in the course of fully understanding the immortal revolutionary history that fully encapsulates the greatness of the Party and the leader. The schools should intensify their education through the exploits of three commanders of Mt. Paektu in leading the work of the schools so that their students can fully understand their greatness and steadfastly carry on the revolution. The schools should educate their students to have a stronger revolutionary faith and to be more faithful to their obligations than anybody else. The revolution is conducted by dint of faith and obligation, and it is thanks to them that the life of revolutionaries shines. Revolutionary faith and obligation are the most ennobling qualities of revolutionaries, which they should safeguard even at the cost of their lives. By intensifying education in faith and obligation in various forms and by various methods as suited to the ages and psychological features of the students, 5 the revolutionary schools should ensure that they all absolutely trust and follow only the Party and the leader that have brought them up, and become people with a strong faith and sense of obligation who will hold fast to the red flag of the revolution, the flag of the glorious Party, even if it means giving up their lives. Kim Jong Il’s patriotism is vital ideological and spiritual sustenance which our Party and people should cherish for generation after generation and the most powerful stimulant of the prosperity of Juche Korea. The revolutionary schools should conduct effective education in Kim Jong Il’s patriotism in conformity with their actual conditions so that the students become true patriots of the Songun era who treasure every single blade of grass and every single tree and tend them with care, who boundlessly love their country and fellow people, and who give their all for the prosperity of their socialist motherland and the happiness of the people. The collectivist spirit is an important ideological and emotional quality for revolutionaries, and socialist morality is an important quality for those living in a Juche-based socialist society. Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School should direct efforts to the education in collectivism and morality so as to train all their students to be genuine revolutionaries and people of conscience who think of their organization and collective before themselves, who are prepared to sacrifice themselves for the organization and collective and who embody the beautiful moral ethics of the Songun era. These revolutionary schools should channel efforts into training their students to be talented revolutionaries with profound scientific and technological knowledge. Ours is an era which develops by dint of science and technology, and we live by relying on them; it is an era of 6 competing practical abilities. No matter how excellent their ideological and mental states, the students will be unable to discharge their responsibilities and roles in the future as the leading personnel at the honourable posts of the revolution assigned to them by the Party, if they are not possessed of rich scientific and technological knowledge. General Kim Jong Il established a prodigy-training, technological education system at the revolutionary schools, which he furnished with every condition for training talented revolutionaries with ample scientific and technological knowledge. It was the General’s wish that commanding personnel of the People’s Army capable of skilfully commanding operations and modern warfare using cutting-edge science and technology and world-startling inventors in the sphere of military science should be produced from among the graduates of the revolutionary schools. The revolutionary schools should intensify their education in mathematics and other basic sciences. Intensifying education in the basic sciences is very important, in that it gives students a wide range of knowledge about nature and society and establishes a firm basis for them to master the latest science and cutting-edge technology in specialist spheres. Education in the basic sciences should put the main emphasis on promoting students’ intellectual faculties with which they can approach the various laws and principles governing matters and phenomena in relation with one another and conceive and invent new things by applying in practice what they have learned. These revolutionary schools should pay special attention to intensifying their computer education. The scope of computer use is being rapidly expanded in the political, military, economic and all other spheres of social life, 7 and this demands that computer education be further intensified at schools. The students of the revolutionary schools should be able to work skilfully with computers and make effective use of them if they are to organize and command operations and modern warfare or play a core role in various fields of society. By increasing the proportion of their computer-related subjects, the revolutionary schools should help their students to cultivate the ability to work skilfully with computers and make effective use of applications. These revolutionary schools should direct efforts to teaching foreign languages so that their students can master more than one foreign language and speak them fluently. The great General took the benevolent measure of establishing an economics course at Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School, with a view to preparing its students to be reserve women cadres who could play a full role in the jobs entrusted to them by the Party after their military service. The revolutionary school should, true to his expectations, improve the teaching of economicsrelated subjects and thus train all its students to be women revolutionaries of the Songun era and true daughters of the Party who are capable of playing a core role in the effort to build a powerful Paektusan nation. Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School should direct great efforts to giving their students basic military knowledge, true to their mission as bases for training reserve officers of the People’s Army. The students of Mangyongdae Revolutionary School are reserve cadres who will be enrolled in Kim Il Sung Military University and other military academies at different levels and become the backbone of the various arms and services of the People’s Army, so they should be given systematic education in basic military knowledge such as the general structures of 8 aircraft, tanks, ships and other military hardware, and the principles of their operation. Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School should press ahead with teaching military subjects and with military training, with the main emphasis on teaching its students how to command and manage army units and other military knowledge they will need during their active service, so as to train them to be reserve women officers who are steel-strong and soldierly. Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School should also stress art and sports education. Only when they have rich aesthetic appreciation, high cultural attainments and good sporting skills can the students become effective workers in the future who are capable of mixing well with the masses and rousing them actively to implement the Party’s policies, and leading personnel of the Songun era who enjoy the respect and trust of the masses. These revolutionary schools should educate their students to be all-round and versatile young people by encouraging them to acquire ample knowledge and broad understanding in various fields including history, geography and literature, learn to play more than one musical instrument and take an active part in sports activities during their school days. It is important steadily to improve both the methods and the contents of teaching. Only by steadily updating their teaching methods in keeping with the requirements of the developing reality can these revolutionary schools improve the quality of their education and produce the competent people needed by the Party. These revolutionary schools should uphold the Party’s policy of bringing about a radical improvement in education in the new century and lead other educational institutions in the country in boldly doing away with outmoded teaching methods and 9 stereotypes that have long been present in the education sector and in creating Juche-oriented teaching methods that suit our actual conditions. They should decisively do away with dictation, rotelearning and other cramming methods of teaching, and fully apply the heuristic methods of teaching, whose advantages have been confirmed. They should give precedence to theoretical education, combine visual aids with demonstrations in lessons, and encourage the question-and-answer method, discussion and debate, so as to give fullest play to the students’ faculty of thinking. And to keep up with the developing reality, they should continuously develop new teaching methods that will enable the students to enhance their intellectual faculties and application abilities, and actively introduce them in teaching. An important way to improve the quality of education at the revolutionary schools is to speed up the process of putting of education on an IT and modern footing. These revolutionary schools should renovate their laboratories and training areas in line with the demands of the times, the purpose of their education and the characteristics of the students’ ages, and ensure that the material and technical foundations of education that have already been established prove effective. To effect a fundamental change in the education of the revolutionary schools, it is necessary to enhance the sense of responsibility and role of their teaching staff. The teaching staff should devote their all to performing their revolutionary duties out of a sense of unique pride and dignity in bringing up the sons and daughters of the Supreme Commander, the pillars of Songun Korea. They should become the fertilizer that fosters immaculate and sound fruit in the excellent gardens of Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School. Teachers are in direct charge of educational work. They 10 should devote all their wisdom and enthusiasm to teaching, the major revolutionary task assigned to them. They should work out teaching plans, putting special emphasis on thoroughly ensuring the political and ideological character, scientific accuracy and applicability of the contents of education, and pay close attention to conducting all forms of education, including lessons, extracurricular teaching and seminars, in conformity with the levels of the students and their ages and psychological features. They should try hard to give students lessons and guide their revision in a straightforward way and in combination with everyday life, as suited to their psychology. These revolutionary schools should improve their educational administration, so as to formulate and properly implement their teaching programmes based on the requirements of Party policy and the theses on socialist education, and in line with the development trend of science and technology and the present realities in our country. To transform the teachers on a revolutionary pattern and raise their qualifications is of great importance in improving the education and edification at these schools and training the students to be ardent revolutionaries and competent personnel. In order to train the students to be revolutionaries of the Juche type who faithfully support the Party and the leader with revolutionary faith and obligation, teachers, before anyone else, should become genuine revolutionaries with perfect moral qualities. The teachers at these revolutionary schools ought to be far superior in their revolutionary and political preparedness compared to their counterparts at other educational institutions. They should endeavour to transform themselves on a revolutionary pattern through their activities in an organization, studying and practice, and thus become model educational workers. 11 They should not only be well versed in their major fields of study but also build up a greater wealth of knowledge of cuttingedge science and technology; they should acquire high qualifications for applying their knowledge to their practical teaching in accordance with the students’ levels. Thus they should be capable of teaching the students everything they want to know; in other words, they should become “our well-informed teachers” and “walking dictionaries.” They should study constantly without wasting a moment so as to raise their scientific and theoretical standards and educational qualifications. The traits displayed by the anti-Japanese guerrilla army in the forests of Paektu should prevail at these revolutionary schools. The schools should improve their physical appearance and establish a steel-strong military ethos by establishing the way of life of the anti-Japanese guerrillas. These revolutionary schools should not indulge their students, on the plea that they are precious, but make exact demands on them in order to train them physically and mentally through their daily routine. Thus, they should make sure that the students acquire in their childhood the soldier mentality. It is the duty and noble obligation of the teaching staff at the schools to take loving care of the students whom Generalissimo Kim Jong Il treasured and took so much care of. They should take care of the students with a sense of parental affection and ensure that the students regard their schools as their homes. Before being educators, they should be parents. They should show the students family love so that they feel not an iota of gloom, and always look after them so that they do not experience the slightest inconvenience in their lives. In this way, they should see to it that the students are always happy and in good health and do not feel at all homesick. They should make strenuous efforts to make their daily life varied as suited to the 12 psychology of the students who are away from their homes, and to prepare different kinds of food according to their tastes. The officials and teaching staff at these schools should ensure that the Party’s affection and solicitude for the students reach them. Only those who are constantly racking their brains and running until they drop in order to convey our Party’s affection to them are qualified to work at the revolutionary schools. The officials and teaching staff at these revolutionary schools should display a high sense of duty and responsibility in bringing up the sons and daughters of the Supreme Commander and look after them all the time on my behalf, so that they are singing before they know it that our home is the Party’s bosom, we are all blood brothers and sisters and we are the happiest children in the world. The students at Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School are all sons and daughters of the Workers’ Party of Korea who share the same blood as the Party, and they are also my sons and daughters. They should always remember the Great generalissimos’ trust and benevolence that are higher than the sky and deeper than the sea, and make redoubled efforts to prepare themselves to be strong pillars of Songun Korea. Even though they may be wearing the badge of revolutionary school graduate on their chest, they cannot become leading personnel of the revolution needed by the Party if they fail to prepare themselves politically and ideologically and possess no practical abilities. They should voluntarily and faithfully participate in organizational and routine activities so as to cultivate a high degree of revolutionary spirit and sense of organization, a strong militant spirit and sense of discipline, and thus become model students who are good at sports and the arts and well-mannered. They should study hard, holding aloft the slogan “Let us learn 13 for Korea!” which Generalissimo Kim Jong Il put forward during his days at Mangyongdae Revolutionary School, so as to prepare themselves to be competent revolutionary personnel who can play a major role in the struggle to translate the intentions of the Generalissimos into practice. The whole Party, the whole country and the whole army should render substantial assistance to Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School. Senior officials of the Party, state and army should frequently visit the schools and solve any problems in a responsible way. Officials who are indifferent to the affairs of the revolutionary schools are paying no heed to the future of the revolution. Nationwide efforts should be directed to improving the revolutionary schools’ furnishings so as to make them model units for the whole country. We should spare nothing for the good of the students of the revolutionary schools who are priceless treasures of our revolution, whom the great persons of Mt. Paektu valued and loved most, and who, as the comrades-in-arms of the Supreme Commander, will share life and death with me on the road of the Songun revolution. These revolutionary schools should be fully equipped with the latest educational facilities, including computers, TV sets, electronic boards and media players and provided with textbooks and school things on a preferential basis. These schools should have ideal educational facilities and any problems arising in running them should be settled promptly, so that their educational conditions and environment can reach the highest level in the world. Sporting apparatuses, musical instruments and all the other things needed by the students in their cultural and emotional life should be provided to the schools in full. Close attention should be paid to ensuring that the supply service system established by Generalissimo Kim Jong Il is fully 14 effective. Units assigned to provide the revolutionary schools with supplies should further raise their sense of responsibility. Only a teacher who is politically and ideologically prepared and practically qualified can bring up excellent personnel. Measures should be adopted at the state level to assign excellent graduates of such prestigious and authoritative universities as Kim Il Sung University to the revolutionary schools on a preferential basis. Enhancing the militant functions and role of the Party organizations at the schools is an important guarantee for improving their work. Party organizations should constantly step up the work of firmly establishing the command system of the Supreme Commander at the schools, treating it as the major line of their work, and thus ensure that all the teaching staff and students always breathe the same air with the Party and are boundlessly loyal to the Party’s ideas and leadership. They should conduct the Party’s political work in a fresh way by closely combining it with educational work and provide substantial guidance to the teaching staff and students in their organizational and ideological activities. Our Party puts great trust in and has high expectations of the graduates of Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School. These graduates should become the hard core and play the role of pioneer in staunchly carrying forward the lineage of Mangyongdae, the lineage of Paektu, as befits the sons and daughters of Mangyongdae, the sons and daughters of Mt. Paektu, who grew up under the care of the three commanders of Mt. Paektu. They should at all times and in all places know nobody except the Party and the leader that embraced them and 15 brought them up to be revolutionaries, and by firmly establishing a revolutionary outlook on the leader and inheriting the precious traditions of defending the leader to the death, they should become faithful bodyguards who defend the Party and the leader politically and ideologically and with their very lives, under any circumstances. They should display boundless devotion and a self-sacrificing spirit in implementing the instructions of the great Generalissimos and the Party’s policies, and possess a high degree of Party spirit and revolutionary spirit and a strong sense of organization and discipline by which they do anything the Party asks of them. They should play the core role in supporting the Party’s Songun-based revolutionary leadership by firmly keeping to their posts. The posts taken by graduates of these revolutionary schools are all important revolutionary posts entrusted to them by the Party with a belief in them, and posts that are indispensable for upholding the Party’s ideas and leadership. Wherever they are working and whatever they are doing, they should not weigh the importance of their posts and duties, but perform their assignments with a sense of responsibility and sincerity; they should work fresh miracles and feats, leading the masses in the vanguard in response to the Party’s call. Particularly those who are serving in the army wearing the military uniform of the revolution should always remember that the Supreme Commander put the final signature to the operational plan for accomplishing the great cause of national reunification, and fully prepare their units and sub-units for combat. The graduates of these revolutionary schools should share good times and bad with the masses, serve their country and fellow people with devotion, not expect any special favours, and always be modest and lead a frugal life. 16 They should cultivate themselves ceaselessly and temper themselves in a revolutionary manner. No one can ever be a perfect revolutionary, so there is no end to revolutionary self-improvement and training. Although they work at important posts after graduating from the revolutionary schools and universities, they cannot carry on the lineage and spirit of their revolutionary forerunners and add lustre to their lives if they do not continuously improve and train themselves. They should study the works of President Kim Il Sung and General Kim Jong Il and the Party’s policies more deeply than anybody else to make them part of their firm faith, participate sincerely in organizational activities and constantly train themselves in revolutionary practice. They should pay special attention to the edification of their children so that they never forget their origins but steadfastly continue the revolution. Party organizations at all levels should effectively help the graduates of these revolutionary schools and give prominence to them so that they are exemplary and play the core role in all aspects of their work and life, as befits the sons and daughters of the Party who grew up drinking the water and breathing the air of Mangyongdae, and with the spirit of Mangyongdae. True to the noble will of the great Generalissimos, the eternal fathers of the sons and daughters of revolutionary martyrs, our Party will take responsible care of their destiny. The future of the sons and daughters of our revolutionary martyrs is bright and promising, and final victory is sure to be won because these dependable successors to the Songun revolution are steadfastly carrying forward the lineage of Mangyongdae, the lineage of Paektu. I firmly believe that Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and Kang Pan Sok Revolutionary School, in line with the Party’s ideas 17 and intentions, will bring up the sons and daughters of Mangyongdae as a dependable backbone who can take responsibility for the affairs of the Party, state and army, and that all the sons and daughters of revolutionary martyrs will become vanguard fighters who support the Songun-based leadership of the Party.",today mark anniversary founding mangyongdae revolutionary school kang pan sok revolutionary school warmly congratulate teaching staff student graduate these

1.1.2013,Kim Jong-un,"Dear comrades, Officers and men of the heroic People's Army and all the beloved fellow countrymen, Dear compatriots, Having seen out the year 2012 characterized by the events that will go down in the history of the nation, we are seeing in the new year 2013 full of high hope and confidence in final victory. Reflecting the unanimous reverence of all the service personnel and people for President Kim Il Sung and General Kim Jong Il, the fathers of the nation and eternal Sun of Juche, I would like first to pay the highest tribute and New Year greetings to them. I extend my warm greetings to the service personnel and people who are devotedly striving for the prosperity of the country, firmly united around the Workers' Party of Korea, and sincerely wish all the families across the country harmony and greater happiness. My New Year greetings also go to our compatriots in the south and abroad who are ringing in the new year with yearning and expectations for the reunification and prosperity of the nation and the world's progressive peoples and our foreign friends who love justice and peace. Last year was a historic year in which the great Generalissimos were upheld as the eternal leaders of our revolution and a firm guarantee was provided for brilliantly carrying forward the revolutionary cause of Juche to completion under the leadership of the Party. The President and the General were great leaders whom our people acclaimed for the first time in their history spanning thousands of years; they are the eternal images of the great Paektusan nation and 1 banners of all victories and glory. Last year we celebrated the centenary of the birth of the President as the greatest national holiday, reviewed the 100-year history of Juche Korea with pride and held up the General as the eternal leader of our Party and people, realizing the cause of immortalizing the leader. By doing so, we have been able to glorify the new century of the Juche era as the annals of victory and glory for the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of Juche under the unfurled banner of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. Although they saw in 2012 in tears of blood after the sudden demise of the General whom they had believed in as in heaven, our service personnel and people determinedly rose up following the Party with firm faith that the great General would always be with them and fully supported the leadership of the Party. With loyalty as pure as white gem, noble sense of moral obligation and all sincerity, they refurbished the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in the most sublime way as befits the supreme sanctuary of Juche and erected the statues of the Generalissimos on Mansu Hill and in several other places. Placing deep trust in and faithfully supporting the Party, they established the ties of blood with it, their hearts pulsating in the same beats with it, and always shared sweets and bitters with it. Major political celebrations held amid the deep interest of the whole nation and the days of last year bore testimony to the single-hearted unity between the Party, the army and the people which was further consolidated to be unbreakable ties of blood. Last year our service personnel and people achieved historic victories which would brilliantly shine in the history of the country by waging a general offensive to put the intentions and instructions of the General into practice. Our reliable scientists and technicians successfully launched the artificial earth satellite Kwangmyongsong 3-2, carrying out the instruction of the General with credit and fully demonstrating the high level of space science and technology and overall national power of Juche Korea. That we successfully manufactured and launched the scientific and technological satellite by entirely relying on our own efforts, technology and wisdom was an event of national jubilation that raised the dignity and honor of the Sun's nation onto the highest level and a great event which inspired all the service personnel and people with confidence in sure victory and courage and clearly showed that Korea does what it is determined to do. Through the parade held in celebration of the centenary of the birth of the President, our revolutionary armed forces demonstrated the inexhaustible might of the powerful revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu steadfast in ideology and faith and equipped with Korean-style modern military hardware capable of defeating any formidable enemy. And they reliably safeguarded the security of the country by resolutely smashing every war provocation and anti-DPRK smear campaign of the enemy. The officers and men of 2 the People's Army and the People's Internal Security Forces made breakthroughs on all major fronts of building a thriving country with the mettle of ""At a go"" and did many good things for the happiness of the people, thereby living up to the expectations and trust of the Party and people. Although the situation was acute and complicated and severe natural calamities hit the country in succession last year, our army and people made great strides in their efforts to build a thriving socialist country and improve the people's living standards by displaying an indomitable will and waging an unyielding struggle. We put the Huichon Power Station and Tanchon Port into commission, built many Juche-oriented and modern factories and enterprises and reconstructed major production bases in key industrial sectors on the basis of advanced science and technology, thus further consolidating the material and technological foundations of our economy. Thanks to the exalted patriotic zeal of the service personnel and people, monumental edifices including Changjon Street and Rungna People's Pleasure Park sprang up in Pyongyang and many cultural facilities for the promotion of the wellbeing of the people were built in different parts of the country, changing its looks. Last year, the superior socialist education system was further consolidated through the adoption of the law on enforcing universal 12-year compulsory education; our sports people achieved laudable successes in international games, adding glory to the country; and our revolutionary artistes conducted artistic activities in a fresh and enterprising manner, imbuing society with an animating spirit and greatly encouraging the people in their struggle. The brilliant successes we achieved in the revolutionary struggle and construction work last year were ascribable to the fact that the General had unfolded an ambitious blueprint and laid firm foundations for the building of a thriving country. Last year's significant successes were a valuable fruit born of the unshakeable determination and correct leadership of our Party to glorify Kim Il Sung's and Kim Jong Il's Korea all over the world by translating the far-reaching plan and instructions of the General into reality and the lofty sense of loyalty and patriotic devotion of our service personnel and people unfailingly faithful to the Party. I extend my warm thanks to all the service personnel and people who adorned the first year of the new century of the Juche era with great victories in hearty response to the Party's militant call. Comrades, The new year 2013 is a year of great creations and changes in which a radical turnabout will be effected in the building of a thriving socialist country on the road of the onward march in the new century of Kim Il Sung's and Kim Jong Il's Korea. 3 All the people and service personnel should dynamically turn out in the grand onward march for building a thriving country full of pride of victors and confidence in a rosy future. The road of Juche is the only path for our Party and people to invariably follow and great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is the ever-victorious banner of our revolution. We should march forward along the road of independence, the road of Songun and the road of socialism to the end upholding the banner of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. Our Party will triumphantly build a thriving socialist nation, the most powerful country, on this land in our own way, the way the General did, by relying on our people who are the best in the world. This year we will be greeting the 65th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, our glorious motherland, and the 60th anniversary of the victory in the great Fatherland Liberation War. The dignified and glorious present of our people and the bright prosperous future of our country are ensured by the immortal nation-building exploits the Generalissimos performed while founding a genuine state of the people for the first time in the 5 000-year-long history of our nation and developing it into a powerful socialist country that is independent, self-sufficient and self-reliant in national defence and by the great achievements the President made while leading the Fatherland Liberation War to brilliant victory on the strength of his outstanding strategy and tactics and wise leadership. In this significant year we should add brilliance to the immortal achievements of the great Generalissimos and make persevering efforts to build a thriving socialist country and carry out the cause of reunifying the country. The building of an economic giant is the most important task that comes to the fore in the present stage of building a thriving socialist country. We should further consolidate the successes achieved so far in economic construction to raise the status of our country to that of an economic giant in the new century, thus realizing the wish of the great General who devoted all his life to making our people well off with nothing to envy in the world. In the same manner as we demonstrated the dignity and might of Songun Korea through the manufacture and launch of the Juche-based application satellite, the entire Party, the whole country and all the people should wage an all-out struggle this year to effect a turnaround in building an economic giant and improving the people’s standard of living. ""Let us bring about a radical turn in the building of an economic giant with the same spirit and mettle as were displayed in conquering space!"" -- this is the fighting slogan our Party and people should uphold this year. 4 All sectors and all units of the national economy should launch a vigorous general offensive to boost production in hearty response to the Party's militant slogan. All economic undertakings for this year should be geared to effecting a radical increase in production and stabilizing and improving the people's living standards by solidifying and making effective use of the already-built foundations of the independent national economy. By adopting decisive steps to shore up the vanguard sectors of the national economy and the sectors of basic industries, we should develop coal-mining, electric-power and metallurgical industries and rail transport on a preferential basis and provide a firm springboard for the building of an economic giant. We should make innovations in coal-mining and metallurgical industries in particular so as to revitalize the overall economy of the country. The success in economic construction should be manifested in the people's standard of living. We should direct great efforts to bolstering up the sectors and units that have a direct bearing on the people's livelihoods and increasing production there, so as to give them more benefits in living. Agriculture and light industry remain the major fronts for economic construction this year, too. We should fulfil this year's plan for grain production without fail by concentrating nationwide efforts on farming and raising the efficiency of agricultural production by dint of scientific and intensive methods. We should take concrete measures for the supply of raw and other materials to light-industry factories and thus increase the output of quality consumer goods. We should decisively bolster up livestock, fish and fruit farming to provide the people with a better, more bountiful diet. The soldiers of the People’s Army and the shock-brigade members who volunteered to work at the reclamation site of Sepho tableland in response to the Party's call should achieve miraculous successes and perform heroic feats in this year's campaign to open a bright prospect for carrying the Party's grand nature-remaking plan to completion at an earlier date. We should wage a dynamic struggle to boost production at the modern factories and production bases that were built under the leadership of the General who, going on with his super-intense forced march, made painstaking efforts to improve the people's living standards. By doing so, we should ensure that his ennobling affection reaches the people as it is. All sectors and all units of the national economy should push ahead with a socialist emulation drive to reenergize production and fulfil their quotas as fixed in the national economic plan for this year. We should bring about a radical turn in the building of an economic giant on the strength of science and technology by fanning the flames of the industrial revolution in the new century. 5 The industrial revolution in the new century is, in essence, a scientific and technological revolution, and breaking through the cutting edge is a shortcut to the building of an economic giant. Like the satellite scientists who conquered outer space we should wage a dynamic campaign to push back the frontiers of science and technology so as to develop the country's overall science and technology to the world standards as soon as possible. All sectors of the national economy should direct primary efforts to the development of science and technology, bring science and technology into close combination with production in order to boost production by relying on domestic resources and technology, and introduce CNC technology in equipment and production lines and achieve their full automation in the long run. We should improve economic guidance and management as demanded by the developing reality. All sectors of the national economy should make scrupulous arrangements for economic planning and guidance to boost production by tapping every possible reserve and potentiality, and work out in a scientific way the immediate plans and long-term strategies for stage-by-stage development and push ahead with them in a persistent manner. We should hold fast to the socialist economic system of our own style, steadily improve and perfect the methods of economic management on the principle of encouraging the working masses to fulfil their responsibility and role befitting the masters of production, and generalize on an extensive scale the good experiences gained at several units. We should continue to channel great efforts into consolidating our political and military might in every way. The single-hearted unity of the army and people around the Party is our strongest weapon and a powerful propellant for the building of a thriving socialist country. We should invariably carry forward the proud tradition of single-hearted unity, the tradition of adorning the red flag of the revolution only with victories on the strength of the harmonious whole wherein the Party believes in the people and the latter absolutely trust and follow the former. All officials, Party members and other working people should become genuine comrades united with a single heart, who share ideology and purpose, weal and woe with our Party on the road of the Songun revolution, and make devoted efforts for the sake of their country and people. They should orient all undertakings towards defending and cementing the single-hearted unity, and strengthen the political and ideological position of our revolution as solid as a rock by grasping the people's sentiments and rallying broad sections of the people firmly behind the Party. The military might of a country represents its national strength; only when it builds up its military might in every way can it develop into a thriving country and defend the security and happiness of its people. We should put continued stress on increasing our military might under the great banner of 6 Songun, reliably safeguard the security and sovereignty of the country and render services to assuring regional stability and global peace. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the advancing of the slogan ""a-match-for-a-hundred"" by the great Generalissimo Kim Il Sung. It is important to bring about a fundamental change in strengthening our revolutionary armed forces and perfecting their combat preparedness. The People’s Army should set up a revolutionary command system and military climate, establish steel-strong military discipline and perfect its regularized features as befits an elite revolutionary force. It should make its training more intensive, as the anti-Japanese guerrillas did on Mt. Paektu, so as to prepare all its officers and men to be a-match-for-a-hundred combatants who have acquired capabilities for actual warfare, and maintain full combat readiness. If the aggressors dare launch a preemptive attack against our sacred country, the People's Army should mercilessly annihilate them and win victory in the war for the country's reunification. Officers and men of the Korean People's Internal Security Forces and members of the Worker-Peasant Red Guards should intensify combat and political training and maintain full combat readiness with a determination to safeguard their Party and leader, country and people, and defend their hometowns. The sector of defence industry should develop in larger numbers sophisticated military hardware of our own style that can contribute to implementing the Party's military strategy, thereby fulfilling its mission as the arsenal of the powerful revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu. We should spur the building of a civilized socialist nation to usher in a new era of cultural efflorescence in the 21st century. The thriving socialist country we are building is a civilized socialist one where all its people are possessed of profound cultural knowledge, sturdy physique and noble moral virtues, enjoying a socialist life to their heart's content under the most cultured conditions and environment, and a beautiful and sound lifestyle pervades the whole society. All sectors in cultural construction should implement to the letter the ideas, lines and policies set forth by the General, and develop education, public health, literature and the arts, physical culture, public morals and all other branches as appropriate to an advanced civilized nation. We should develop Pyongyang into a more majestic and picturesque city as befits the capital of Juche Korea, the centre of Songun culture, and turn all streets and villages, mountains and rivers in provinces, cities and counties into a socialist paradise. At the same time we should set up modern cultural and welfare facilities, parks and pleasure grounds in larger numbers, thus making our people enjoy a cultured life of a new era to their heart's content. 7 In order to effect a radical change in this year's campaign to build a thriving socialist country, officials should make a fundamental turnabout in their ideological viewpoint, work style and attitude. Those who acquire the President's and the General's outlook on the people, make tireless efforts for their good, rid themselves of the old way of thinking and attitude and make ceaseless innovations in all work, and rouse the masses to make breakthroughs for the advance, can be rightly claimed to be genuine officials required by our Party at present. Officials should strive with devotion, upholding the slogan ""Everything for the people and everything by relying on them!"" They should work to the best of their abilities with a high sense of responsibility, eagerness and an enterprising approach to work, so that their loyalty and performance can be judged by the Party and the people. Party organizations should further enhance their militant function and role. As the political staff of the units concerned, they should firmly establish policy-oriented principles in implementing the Party's policies and conduct political and organizational work with scrupulous care. By doing so, they should ensure that a great upsurge is brought about in their respective sectors and units. Party organizations, out of maternal feeling, should embrace all the people, take warm care of them and lead them forward to ensure that they share the same destiny with the Party to the end and fulfil their tasks at their posts in a responsible manner. We should conduct Party work in the same way as it was done on the battleline in the 1970s, and put a focus of the work on thoroughly applying Kim Jong Il's patriotism in all activities. Kim Jong Il's patriotism is the eternal soul and breath of Kim Il Sung's nation, and a driving force for the building of a thriving country. Party organizations should ensure that all officials, Party members and other working people cherish Kim Jong Il's patriotism deep in their hearts and give full play to their patriotic enthusiasm and spirit of devoted service in the ongoing sacred struggle to achieve prosperity of their socialist country. Working people's organizations should conduct effective education among their members to suit their specific features, thus inspiring them to an all-out offensive for this year. Youth league organizations should educate young people to dynamically advance straight forward along the road indicated by the Party and become youth heroes who glorify the present era of great upsurge with their creative activities and feats. The reunification of the country is the greatest national task that brooks no further delay and was the lifelong desire and instructions of the great Generalissimos. Deeply grieving over the national division, President Kim Il Sung and General Kim Jong Il, the fathers of the nation and lodestars of national reunification, worked heart and soul throughout their life 8 to hand down a reunified country to their fellow countrymen, laying firm foundations for the independent reunification, peace and prosperity of the nation. We should staunchly safeguard and add brilliance to the undying exploits the great Generalissimos performed for the sacred cause of national reunification, and accomplish the historic cause of the country's reunification, a long-cherished desire of our nation, true to the lofty intention of the peerlessly great persons. This year the entire Korean nation should turn out in a nationwide patriotic struggle for reunification in unity so as to usher in a new phase in the reunification movement. An important issue in putting an end to the division of the country and achieving its reunification is to remove confrontation between the north and the south. The past records of inter-Korean relations show that confrontation between fellow countrymen leads to nothing but war. Anti-reunification forces of south Korea should abandon their hostile policy against their fellow countrymen, but take the road of national reconciliation, unity and reunification. Respecting and thoroughly implementing the north-south joint declarations is a basic prerequisite to promoting the inter-Korean relations and hastening the country’s reunification. All the compatriots in the north, south and abroad should launch a dynamic struggle to carry out to the letter the June 15 Joint Declaration and the October 4 Declaration, great reunification programmes common to the nation in the new century and milestones for peace and prosperity. The reunification issue should be solved by the concerted efforts of our nation in an independent manner. The driving force of the reunification movement is the entire Korean nation, and nothing is impossible if it achieves firm unity. All the members of the Korean nation in the north, south and abroad should subordinate and orientate everything to the great national cause of reunifying the country from the standpoint of giving priority and attaching importance to the nation and achieving its unity. The entire nation should vehemently reject any moves for domination, intervention, aggression and war by outside forces, and never tolerate any acts hindering the country's reunification. Whatever trials and difficulties lie in the way of national reunification, we will build a reunified thriving country without fail on this three-thousand-ri land by the concerted efforts of the whole nation. In the present international arena, the moves of the imperialists to interfere in the internal affairs of other sovereign states and their acts of military aggression pose a serious threat to peace and security of mankind. The Asia-Pacific region, the Korean Peninsula in particular, has become the hottest spot in the world in which constant tension persists. 9 The aspiration and desire of mankind to lead an independent life free from all sorts of domination and subjugation is growing stronger, and no force can stem the trend of history towards independence and justice. The present international situation demands that our Republic continue to advance along the road of independence under the unfurled banner of Songun. By holding fast to the ideals of independence, peace and friendship, we will, in the future, too, strive to develop relations of friendship and cooperation with the countries that are friendly to our country out of their respect for its sovereignty, and safeguard regional peace and stability and make the whole world independent. A brighter and broader vista is open for us in the new year, and only victory and glory are in store for our people on their onward march. Let us vigorously strive to achieve the prosperity of our country, our motherland, firmly rallied behind the Party under the banner of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.",comrade officer man heroic army

31.03.2013,Kim Jong-un,"This Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, which has been convened at an important, historic time when our Party and revolution are marking a turning point in their development, has been held successfully amid the high political enthusiasm of all the participants. The Plenary Meeting discussed and decided on the important issue of simultaneously conducting economic construction and building up our nuclear forces as required by the prevailing situation and the developing revolution. Along with this, the meeting discussed the matter of personnel affairs to be submitted to the Supreme People’s Assembly for deliberation and the issue of recalling and electing officials of the central leadership body of the Party. This Plenary Meeting has established a new, historic milestone in safeguarding and adding lustre to the undying exploits the great President Kim Il Sung and General Kim Jong Il performed in building a nuclear power and in stepping up the building of a thriving socialist country. In the belief that the meeting has conducted thorough and satisfactory discussions on the agenda items, I would like to stress some important problems in carrying out the Party’s strategic line of simultaneously conducting economic construction and building up our nuclear forces. First of all, we should have a correct understanding of the Party’s intention in putting forward this strategic line. Our Party’s line is not a temporary countermeasure adopted to cope with the rapidly-changing situation, but a strategic line we should hold fast to permanently in view of the supreme interests of our revolution. It is also the absolutely right line that can ensure that 1 our people enjoy all the benefits of nuclear power and socialism. In advancing this line the Party’s intention is to make our possession of a self-defensive nuclear capability permanent against the reckless nuclear threat and aggressive moves by the imperialists and their vassal forces and, on the basis of this, achieve a decisive victory in building an economic giant. All officials, Party members and other working people should be firmly convinced of the justness of our Party’s line and turn out as one in the effort to implement it, full of confidence in victory. By concentrating all our efforts, we must bring about a decisive turn in building an economic giant. The enemy are afraid of our satellite and nuclear weapons; what they fear even more is our acceleration of building an economic giant and improving the people’s standard of living to such a level that the people shout “Long live the Workers’ Party!” from the bottom of their hearts. Now that our country has become a fully-fledged nuclear state, favourable conditions have been created for us to concentrate funds and labour on the campaign for economic construction and improving the people’s standard of living by relying on our powerful war deterrent. In the effort to build an economic giant, we must gear all our work to making maximum and effective use of the foundations of the self-supporting economy laid by the Generalissimos so as to normalize production at a high level and fully satisfy the material and cultural needs of the people. Officials, Party members and other working people must have firm confidence in victory and extraordinary determination in the face of the manifold hardships and trials, and wage a bold offensive, a decisive nationwide campaign, thus working miracles and innovations in all sectors of the national economy. Ceaselessly strengthening our self-defence capabilities with 2 the nuclear forces as the backbone is a sure guarantee for defending the rights of our nation to independence and existence and for achieving national prosperity. So long as the imperialists persist with nuclear blackmail and threat of aggression, we can never weaken our nuclear armaments and must continue to develop the Juche-based atomic energy industry even as one generation is replaced by another and whatever the change in the situation. Although our nuclear power is being further strengthened, the service personnel and other people should not rest on their laurels, but further prepare themselves politically and ideologically, and when the day of the life-and-death battle arrives, they must win final victory in the anti-US showdown on the strength of the great unity among them. By enhancing their functions and role, Party organizations must dynamically enlist their members and other working people in implementing the Party’s line of simultaneously conducting economic construction and building up our nuclear forces. The main spirit of the current Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee of the Party is that we must win final victory in the anti-US showdown and in building a thriving socialist country through resolute attack. Party organizations must concentrate Party work on implementing the Party’s line of simultaneously conducting economic construction and building up our nuclear forces and instil in their members and other working people the main spirit of this Plenary Meeting. In this way, they can encourage all service personnel and other people to turn out as one and proudly take part in the anti-US showdown and build an economic giant by our own efforts before the eyes of the world. Party organizations must train all their members to be staunch advocates of the Party’s policies and enthusiastic fighters who give 3 their all to implementing the Party’s lines and policies. However severe the situation may be and whatever difficulties we may encounter, we are afraid of nothing, and there is no fortress that we cannot conquer so long as we have the single-hearted unity of the army and the people rallied firmly around the Party and the absolutely correct line of our Party on simultaneously conducting economic construction and building up our nuclear forces. The world will clearly see how we smash the anti-DPRK schemes of the imperialists and their followers and build a thriving socialist country on this land. The Party Central Committee firmly believes that all officials, Party members and other working people will demonstrate to the whole world once again the dignity and mettle of Songun Korea by upholding and striving hard to implement the Party’s line of simultaneously conducting economic construction and building up our nuclear forces.",plenary meeting central committee worker party korea convene important historic party revolution mark turning point hold successfully amid political enthusiasm participant plenary meeting discuss decide important issue simultaneously conduct build nuclear force require prevail situation develop revolution along meeting discuss matter personnel affair submit supreme assembly deliberation issue recall elect official central leadership body party plenary meeting establish new historic milestone safeguard add lustre undying exploit sung general jong perform build nuclear power step building thriving socialist belief meeting conduct thorough satisfactory discussion agenda item stress important problem carry party strategic simultaneously conduct build nuclear force first correct understanding party intention put forward strategic party temporary countermeasure adopt cope rapidly change situation strategic hold fast permanently view supreme interest revolution absolutely right ensure enjoy benefit nuclear power socialism advance party intention possession self defensive nuclear capability permanent reckless nuclear threat aggressive move imperialist vassal force basis achieve decisive victory build giant official party member work firmly convinced justness party turn effort implement full confidence victory concentrate effort bring decisive turn build giant enemy afraid satellite nuclear weapon fear acceleration build giant improve standard live level shout long live worker party bottom heart now fully fledge nuclear favourable condition create concentrate fund labour campaign improve standard living rely war deterrent effort giant gear make maximum effective foundation self support economy lay generalissimos normalize production level fully satisfy material cultural need official party member work firm confidence victory extraordinary determination face manifold hardship trial wage bold offensive decisive nationwide campaign work miracle innovation sector economy ceaselessly strengthen self defence capability nuclear force backbone sure guarantee defend right nation independence existence achieve prosperity long imperialist persist nuclear blackmail threat aggression never weaken nuclear armament continue juche base atomic energy industry generation replace another whatever change situation although nuclear power be far strengthen service personnel rest laurel far prepare themselves politically ideologically life death battle arrive win final victory anti showdown strength enhance function role party organization dynamically enlist member work implement party simultaneously conduct build nuclear force main spirit current plenary meeting central committee party win final victory anti showdown build thriving socialist resolute attack party organization concentrate party implement party simultaneously conduct build nuclear force instil member work main spirit plenary meeting encourage service personnel turn proudly part anti showdown giant own effort before eye party organization train member staunch advocate party policy enthusiastic fighter implement party line policy severe situation whatever difficulty encounter afraid nothing there fortress conquer long single hearted army rally firmly party absolutely correct party simultaneously conduct build nuclear force clearly smash anti dprk scheme imperialist follower thriving socialist land party central committee firmly believe official party member work demonstrate once again dignity mettle songun korea uphold strive hard implement party simultaneously conduct build nuclear force
08.12.2013,Kim Jong-un,"It is of great significance that a grand short course of officials in the construction sector is being held for the first time in the construction history of our country when a heyday is being unfolded in construction and a general campaign is being waged for victory this year under the leadership of the Workers’ Party of Korea. This short course, held under the theme Yesterday and Today of Juche-Oriented Architecture and Its Today and Tomorrow, has been convened according to our Party’s plan and on its initiative to review the successes and experiences in the work of the construction sector and usher in a great golden age in this sector in line with the demands of the developing revolution and times. Today, when our Party and revolution have come to a new, historic turning point under the great banner of Songun, they are faced with the important task of scaling at an early date the high peak of building a thriving country, leaping from one decade to the next. In the opening of a decade of the fresh leap forward by Songun Korea, our Party is attaching great importance to the work of the construction sector. Construction is a patriotic cause of lasting significance for building a thriving socialist country, a people’s paradise, and important work for increasing the economic might of the country and raising the level of its civilization. When we build many monumental structures by bringing about innovations in construction, the firm foundations of a thriving country will be laid and a sound basis built for the people’s happiness. Seeing the daily-changing appearance of their prosperous and civilized country, our people will feel a sense of great dignity and revolutionary self-respect and cherish  1 warmer affection for their country. The new construction speeds and the spirit of the times created at the grand construction sites inspire all the people and service personnel to wage a heroic struggle and perform feats in building a thriving country. It is our Party’s steadfast determination to usher in a new age of national prosperity by developing the current heyday in construction into a great golden age of construction in Songun Korea and by making the torchlight of innovation in this sector flare up as the flames of a great leap forward on all the other fronts of socialist construction. Bearing in mind our Party’s purpose in organizing this grand short course, all those attending should gain through it a clear understanding of the blueprint of our Party’s plan for building a socialist economic giant, a civilized country, and the ways to implement the plan; thus they should make the short course an epochal occasion in bringing about another great leap forward in the construction sector. The history of construction in our country is a proud history of achieving miracles and changes by racing against time at the pace of Chollima, spurred on by the speed campaign, guided by the outstanding ideas on architecture of the great Generalissimos and under their wise leadership. The brilliant leadership exploits of Generalissimo Kim Il Sung, who created a new history of Juche-oriented and people-oriented architecture after the liberation of the country and built on the war debris a powerful country with a self-supporting economy, a people’s paradise, and of Generalissimo Kim Jong Il, who put forward a comprehensive Juche-oriented theory on architecture and ushered in a heyday of grand socialist construction, will shine for ever as eternal assets in building a prosperous country. Today, a heyday of construction has been unfolded in our country under the leadership of the Party, with the result that the  2 great Generalissimos’ plan of building a thriving country is being translated into reality. Thanks to the loyalty and heroic struggle of the service personnel of the Korean People’s Army and the construction workers, the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, the supreme sanctuary of Juche, has been laid out in a more solemn way as a grand monument to the immortality of the leaders, and proud structures of the age of the WPK, such as the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum, Unha Scientists Street, Munsu Water Park and Masikryong Ski Resort, which will go well with the appearance of a civilized socialist country in their characters, contents and architectural styles, have been built in the short period of less than one year, instilling in our people a sense of great national dignity and pleasure. The service personnel of the KPA and the construction workers have devoted their sweat and blood unstintingly in carrying out the Party’s construction plan, thus proving in practice that Korea never fails to do what it is determined to do, and demonstrating to the whole world the wisdom and spirit of our people who are charging ahead at full speed; they are indeed heroes of the Songun era and treasures of our Party. I extend warm thanks to those attending the grand short course of officials in the construction sector, the soldier-builders and the construction workers across the country who have displayed burning patriotic enthusiasm and unswerving devotion to usher in a heyday of construction in hearty response to the Party’s long-term construction plan. Today the officials and working people in the construction sector are faced with the heavy yet honourable task of laying the solid foundations of a socialist economic giant in the near future and taking the lead in opening up a new era of cultural attainment in the 21st century by carrying forward and developing the great Generalissimos’ leadership exploits associated with their sector.  3 We should speed up production-related construction on all fronts of the socialist economy, including its vanguard sectors, basic industries, and light industry and agriculture so as to revitalize the national economy as quickly as possible and provide a reliable springboard for the building of an economic giant. We should lay out the capital city of Pyongyang, the heart of Juche Korea and the hub of Songun-based culture, as a city of global standards in all aspects and raise a hot wind of construction across the provinces, cities and counties to remodel them in a beautiful fashion as suited to their characteristic features. By so doing, we can turn the country into a socialist paradise. We should attain a new, higher phase in building a civilized socialist nation by pushing forward the projects for updating the conditions and environment for learning at educational institutions and ensuring the highest quality in setting up healthcare, sports and cultural facilities, as demanded by the times. The goals for the construction sector are gigantic and ambitious. However, because we have the wise leadership of the Party and construction officials and workers who are boundlessly loyal to it, the ideals and dream of our Party and people to build a socialist paradise that is powerful and civilized at the earliest date possible are sure to be realized. The officials and working people in the construction sector should not rest on their laurels but redouble their efforts, occupying the vanguard of the grand campaign for building a thriving country to lead today’s success to a more brilliant victory tomorrow. The guidelines to be followed in carrying out our ambitious construction plan and reaching our goals are the Party’s  4 Juche-oriented idea and theory on architecture and its construction policy. Juche-oriented socialist architecture is, in essence, based on the principle of giving first and foremost importance to the masses of the people, who are responsible for the country’s architecture. It is the people themselves who create it and benefit from it. So it is a natural requirement in construction to give top priority to the aspirations and demands of the people and their convenience and to ensure its perfect ideological and artistic value and usability in conformity with their emotions and aesthetic sense. In construction we should preserve the Juche character by applying the principle of giving first and foremost importance to the masses of the people, combine national identity properly with modernity, and build at an extraordinary speed monumental structures that will surpass global standards and remain immaculate even in the distant future. This is the basic principle which we must abide by in construction and the core of the Juche-oriented idea on architecture. “Let us usher in a great golden age of construction by thoroughly applying the Party’s Juche-oriented idea on architecture!”–this is the militant slogan the officials and working people in the construction sector should hold up at present. They should bring about a revolutionary change in the design, building work and the production of building materials so as to ensure that the country’s construction sector reaches the global standards. Design, building work and building materials are three elements of construction. The key to building excellent structures is the proper combination of these elements. The main requirements of our Party’s policy on developing design, building work and the production of building materials are to abide by the principle of prioritizing convenience over  5 aesthetic beauty, and the construction of infrastructure over that of superstructure, to make construction specialized, industrialized and modern at a high level and to complete projects at one go by adopting finish-one-at-a-time tactics and pressing ahead with them in a three-dimensional way. First of all, we need to develop the architectural design sector rapidly. Architectural design is the initial process in construction and creates an operational map for it. Keeping in mind that the future of a civilized country is visualized first on their drawing boards, architects should guarantee the highest level of excellence in their work, as intended by the Party and desired by the people. They should fully embody the requirements of our Party’s Juche-oriented theory on architecture and its construction policy in their architectural designs. In drawing the designs for a structure, primary attention should be paid to providing the people, its users, with convenience for their comfort and then to creating an environment and conditions with the highest levels of safety, hygiene, sanitation, culture and aesthetics. It is also important to constantly update the formative and artistic features of architecture. It should be regarded as an iron rule in architectural design to give precedence to the designs of infrastructure, with due concern paid to modernizing the infrastructure network in keeping with the world trend. It is important in architectural design to sustain the utility and characteristics of structures. General Kim Jong Il taught us that architecture is a composite art, so similarity and repetition are a taboo in architectural design. Architects should always rack their brains for distinctive designs for structures of various forms that conform with their characteristic features, utility and capacities. As the  6 characteristics and utility of structures are manifested in the formation of the exterior and the interior space, their exterior should be configured and their interior plane arrangement designed so as to conform with their missions and functions. In architectural designs for local areas it is important to avoid the tendency of blindly copying the models in Pyongyang or of drawing them only for style’s sake; they should assume varied and unique forms to bring out the character of each locality. In keeping with the world trend towards green architecture structures to be built should be designed on the principle of promoting the ecological environment and making them friendly to their surroundings. On the other hand, precautions should be taken against adopting architectural forms and trends that are incongruous with the Korean style on the pretext of creating distinctive designs. The level of scientification in architectural design should be raised radically, in line with the demands of the new century. Scientific methods should be introduced into design and its means modernized. Architects cannot present satisfactory designs for world-class structures based solely on their sense of responsibility and duty. The days are gone when designs were drawn on paper. The most pressing issue in putting methods of architectural design on a scientific basis is to develop and use the advanced CAD applications and system of a Korean style. National institutions for architectural design and similar units in the provinces should equip themselves fully with modern devices such as the latest computers and multidimensional design programs so as to ensure scientific accuracy and promptness in their work. Special attention should be paid to ensuring the scientific accuracy of calculation of cost-effectiveness in design. A misplaced dot or line on a design can result in the country’s materials, funds and manpower being wasted in large amounts.  7 From the standpoint that they are answerable to the country and people for the structures they design, architects should map out plans for them carefully in the light of economic profitability and draw designs of each structure only after repeated deliberation. The architectural design sector should develop all its branches rapidly with the great ambition of beating the world. In recent years many monumental structures have been built, and in the course of this our architects have widened their horizons and improved the level of their skills; however, they still lag behind in many aspects in view of the requirements of the Party and people and the world trend of architectural development. For the present, it is important to develop designs for interior decoration, furniture and landscape gardening. Proactive efforts should be made to create green and intelligent architecture in conformity with the aspirations of mankind by adopting the latest world trends and excellent styles of other countries in architectural design. Fresh innovations should be brought about in building work. The process of building work is the major process in construction. However excellent a design may be, if the building work is not done properly, a structure will not meet the requirements of the Party and people. Building work should be put on a specialized basis. Making building work specialized is an important guarantee for higher speed and quality. Radical steps should be taken to consolidate the material and technical foundations of central construction enterprises, improve their employees’ level of technical knowledge and skill, and make up for the shortage of manpower. Provinces, too, should build up their own construction forces. Specialized construction enterprises should work effectively to reinforce their technical personnel and train skilled construction workers. Given the  8 experience in construction this year, it is advisable to second construction forces in the provinces for major projects in Pyongyang so that they can learn advanced construction methods and gain experience. It is important to raise the level of industrialization and modernization decisively in building work. Only then will it be possible to make work easier in the construction sector and carry out construction projects more quickly and better with less expenditure of manpower and materials. Fundamental to putting building work on an industrialized and modern footing is upgrading the equipment, machinery and tools. Since we are to undertake many projects in the coming years in answer to the Party’s call for a construction campaign, we should replace old building equipment, machinery and tools with modern ones. As we have the experience of manufacturing various types of building equipment and as we are supported by firm industrial foundations, we are surely capable of producing and supplying modern building equipment, machinery and tools if we buckle down to it. Factories and enterprises in the machine-building industry and construction units should make positive efforts to produce building equipment, machinery and tools. It is also important to make scrupulous arrangements for importing complete sets of up-to-date building equipment, machinery and tools. Advanced building methods should be introduced proactively. People’s aesthetic standards rise and building methods develop in step with the times. A struggle should be waged to invent and apply various building methods suited to the requirements of the times and the characteristics of the construction projects, and positive efforts be made to adopt the most up-to-date building methods. In order to raise construction  9 to a higher level, we should switch from wet to dry process. The technical regulations and requirements in construction should be strictly observed. The slogan “Let us take responsibility for the safety of the project and guarantee its quality for all eternity” is located at every construction site; this slogan should not be regarded as being simply for the sake of publicity. We should make it a slogan of loyalty and patriotism under which the officials and working people in the construction sector support their Party and love their country, a slogan of clear conscience and practice under which they devote themselves to the well-being of the people and of the rising generations. We should create an example in building work and generalize it. It is our Party’s traditional method of work to create a model in a unit and generalize it across other units. We should raise the overall level of building work by setting up exemplary, model units in the capital and provinces and making all other construction units follow suit. When carrying out a construction project, close attention should be paid to laying out the area surrounding the site. A structure should be completed in parallel with cleaning up the surrounding area and landscaping it with trees and lawns so that the traces of construction are removed entirely, along with the completion of the project. An epochal turn should be made in the production of building materials. Building materials production is decisive to the success or failure of construction. Building materials are to construction what shells and bullets are to the army. Building-materials factories should normalize their production so that they can supply materials for construction in sufficient quantities. Cement factories and the units producing steel for construction should upgrade and perfect their existing production lines and operate their equipment at full capacity, and  10 thus produce and supply quality cement and steel according to the specifications. The production of standard aggregate and prefabs should be industrialized so as to boost their output rapidly. Modern bases for producing building materials should be set up in larger numbers to meet the growing demand for them in the construction sector. The proportion of domestically-produced finishing materials should be raised. To produce building materials by relying on domestic resources is a requisite for the development of construction and, at the same time, it is an important aspect of political work to inspire the people with trust and pride in their own things and enhance their confidence. We should speed up the work of putting production lines on a modern and scientific basis at building-materials factories, including the Taedonggang Tile Factory and the Pyongyang Building-Materials Factory which were built with so much effort under the care of Generalissimo Kim Jong Il, and each factory should specialize in the production of a certain range and high standard of building materials and make it its tradition. Finishing-materials factories should strive for higher quality and make their product range varied. In future, our country should produce all the various kinds of finishing materials we need in construction. We should channel strenuous efforts into developing materials for fittings and furniture so that large quantities of light, durable, convenient and attractive materials are produced. Positive measures should be taken to turn out varieties of quality coating materials by relying on locally-available raw materials. The responsibility and role of the officials and working people in the construction sector should be enhanced so as to usher in a great golden age of construction. They are point men and pioneers who perform the honourable duty of taking the lead in paving the way for the prosperity of  11 Songun Korea and the people’s happy tomorrow. By relying on their ardent loyalty and patriotic zeal, our Party intends to open up a great golden age of construction with a view to translating the people’s ideals and dreams into reality. The officials in the construction sector should work to the best of their abilities and make persevering efforts to carry out the construction plan of the Party, and its intentions. They should set a reasonable order of priority for construction that is in keeping with the requirements for building a thriving nation and the actual conditions in the country, and carry out the tasks assigned to their units by projects and stages in a sweeping manner by displaying their organizational abilities to the full and through bold, daring operations. They should lend an attentive ear to the creative suggestions of the masses and hold serious on-site discussions concerning the problems arising in construction, from the design and building work to the preparations for operating the buildings, so that they can take appropriate measures in time. They should all become locomotives that arouse and lead the masses in the grand construction campaign through personal examples by overcoming difficulties and hardships in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and with indefatigable courage. They should make exacting demands in construction. In construction the criteria are that which is required by the Party and the people. In carrying on any project, officials should not feel satisfied with what they have done, but make greater demands so as to construct all structures as monumental creations which reach the standards required by the Party and the people and are of the highest international standards. They should show special concern for the safety of workers and take scrupulous measures to this end to prevent even the slightest labour accident.  12 They should endeavour to raise the level of their own political and practical qualifications. To them, it is not merely a matter of qualification; it is a matter of eligibility, in other words, whether or not they can keep pace with the Party in the struggle to create a new history of construction for Songun Korea. They should arm themselves fully with our Party’s Juche-oriented idea on architecture and its construction policy and become able, talented personnel who are well versed in their field and the work of their units, as well as in the world trend of architectural development. Construction projects should be carried out on the strength of army-people joint operations. As they have brought about sea changes in all parts of the country by displaying the spirit of moving mountains and filling up seas at the risk of their lives if it is the Supreme Commander’s order, the soldier-builders should continue to perform heroic feats in the vanguard of the sacred struggle to open up a great golden age of construction, and thus demonstrate to the full the proud features of the Party’s army and its might as the architect of people’s happiness. By learning from the fighting spirit of the soldier-builders, the working people in the construction sector should ensure the highest speed and quality in carrying out construction projects, thus leaving an outstanding trace in the ongoing vigorous construction campaign with an ardent, patriotic view of life. Construction science and technology should be developed onto a higher stage. Science and technology are an engine which drives constant advances in construction, and the shortcut to the great golden age of construction is to rapidly develop science and technology in this sector. The scientists and technicians in the construction sector should have the national pride and scientific faith that they will beat the world and should make the best use of the knowledge  13 and talents they have acquired under the care of the Party, so as to provide a scientific and technological guarantee for and push ahead with the grand construction campaign for the country’s prosperity and the people’s well-being. They should further develop architectural design and building work on the basis of intensive research into structural diagrams, scientific methods of calculation and advanced methods of building work which are appropriate to the actual conditions of our country and may lead the world. They should strive to ensure the domestic production of building materials, and increase their variety and improve their quality so that they can compete with world-class ones. They should also make proactive efforts to develop and introduce modern and more efficient equipment, machinery and tools. Emphasis should be put on training scientific and technical personnel in the construction sector. Today, when the heyday of construction is being led into a great golden age for the new century of the Juche era, talented designers and architects are in growing demand. Pyongyang University of Architecture is the base for training talented personnel in Juche-oriented architecture and an outpost in building a civilized socialist country. The university and other educational institutions in the construction sector should put education on an informatized, modern and advanced basis as demanded by the era of the knowledge economy, combine theory with practice, and teaching with productive labour, and guarantee the best conditions and environment for teaching so as to increase the number of able designers and architects who are fully equipped with the Juche-oriented idea on architecture. In order to produce able personnel who are talented in construction science and technology and can render a contribution to building a thriving nation, it is important to select promising people and send them abroad to study and for internships and  14 effectively organize refresher courses for in-service officials. A dissemination centre for construction science and technology should be built and widely used. A wide range of worldwide architectural data should be entered into the central database to enable the relevant organs to gain access to them through a computer network. Supervision and control over construction should be improved and strengthened. Supervision and control should be conducted in a responsible manner in the interests of the Party and the state. With a high sense of being supervisors defending the demands and interests of the Party, the country and the people, officials in this sector should exercise strict control over construction and make increasing demands on design and building work. We should establish a nationwide, unified system of supervision and control over construction. Only then will it be possible to conduct the overall construction of the country in line with the Party’s construction policy, the development orientation for construction set by the state, and the laws and regulations on construction. A proper unified control system by the state has not yet been established in the construction sector. The construction control sector should establish a routine whereby its officials deliberate the designs of structures on site and inspect them upon their completion and exercise control so as to prevent deviations in construction. Construction control organs should establish a system of examining even the preparations for the operation of structures when inspecting them upon their completion. Party guidance to the construction sector should be strengthened. Party organizations should make it a major line to establish a comprehensive system of Party leadership in the construction sector and concentrate all types of Party work on this work.  15 Without establishing the system of Party leadership, it is impossible properly to apply the Party’s Juche-oriented idea on architecture and its construction policy and usher in a great golden age of construction in line with the Party’s intention. All units in the construction sector should establish the strict discipline of accepting the Party’s policy and instructions on construction as absolute and resolving the problems arising in construction according to the Party’s decisions, and carry out self-sacrificingly and unconditionally the tasks the Party has assigned to them. Party organizations should conduct political work in a proactive way so as to give full rein to the mental strength of the officials and working people in the construction sector. The driving force of the construction campaign is the mental strength of the masses of the people. Party organizations should positively encourage and lead the officials and working people in the construction sector so that they cherish Kim Jong Il’s patriotism and devote their patriotic zeal and sincerity to fulfilling on time the tasks assigned to them. They should encourage them all to become performers of feats in the ongoing grand construction campaign by learning from the heroic fighting spirit and revolutionary traits possessed by the elder generations who brought about great innovations and changes by dint of the Chollima spirit and high-speed work in every decade of our revolution. By enlisting every means of information and motivational work, Party organizations should actively motivate them ideologically and widely organize socialist emulation drives; in this way, they can ensure that every construction site is brimming with the spirit of making a leap forward and carrying out tasks self-sacrificingly, militant mettle and revolutionary optimism. Party organizations should intensify education among  16 officials so as to encourage them to strive to develop our own things with a high sense of national self-respect and be proactive in the work of rooting out from among them the tendency of depending on other countries. Since builders are engaged in challenging and labour-consuming work away from home for a long time, Party organizations should regard them as their revolutionary comrades-in-arms and take warm care of them with maternal affection, to ensure that they devote their creative wisdom and zeal at construction sites out of genuine attachment to their job. Great are the Party’s trust in and expectations of the officials and working people in the construction sector in the gigantic struggle to usher in a great golden age of construction by thoroughly applying the Juche-oriented idea on architecture. With a firm determination to translate the Party’s far-reaching construction plan into brilliant reality, they should demonstrate to the whole world the dignity of the powerful Paektusan nation and the spirit of Songun Korea by bringing about a great advance and innovations at construction sites.",significance grand short course official be hold first history heyday be unfold general campaign be

01.01.2014,Kim Jong-un,"Dear comrades, Dear service personnel of the Korean People's Army, all the people and other compatriots, Having seen out 2013, a year in which we left a remarkable footprint on the road of the sacred march of the Juche revolution, we are seeing in the new year 2014 filled with confidence in the future and revolutionary self-respect. Reflecting the boundless yearning and high respect of all the service personnel and people for the great President Kim Il Sung and General Kim Jong Il, I would like first to pay the highest tribute and New Year greetings to them. I extend tribute also to the martyrs who dedicated their precious lives to national defence and socialist construction last year and New Year greetings to all the service personnel and people who are opening a new era of the country's prosperity following the leadership of our Party. And greeting the new year I wish that the families across the country would overflow with greater happiness and joy. My New Year greetings go also to my compatriots in the south, who are fighting for independence, democracy and national reunification, to my compatriots abroad, who are devoting their all to the prosperity of their motherland, and to the progressive peoples of the world and other foreign friends, who love justice and peace. Last year was a proud year in which the entire Party, the whole army and all the people waged an all-out offensive in support of the Party's new line of developing the two fronts simultaneously and thus achieved brilliant successes in building a thriving socialist country and defending socialism. Last year our service personnel and people, firmly rallied behind the Party, exalted the brilliance of the ideas and cause of the President and the General and strengthened the political and ideological might of our revolutionary ranks all the more. Through the political events held in celebration of the 65th anniversary of the founding of the DPRK and the 60th anniversary of victory in the Fatherland Liberation War and in the whole course of last year's struggle, they demonstrated their firm faith and will in holding the President and the General in high esteem and carrying forward their imperishable exploits to posterity. Our Party's policies of respecting the people and loving them and the people's hearty loyalty of trusting and following the Party as they would do their mothers have become integrated, and thus the bloodsealed ties between them have reached a new, higher stage. In the seething period of the effort for building a thriving country last year we took the resolute measure of removing the factionalists lurking in the Party. As our Party detected and purged the anti-Party, counterrevolutionary factionalists at an opportune time and with a correct decision, the Party and revolutionary ranks were further consolidated and our single-hearted unity was solidified to the maximum. Through this struggle our Party affirmed that as a party that serves the people, it will fully discharge the honourable mission it has assumed for the times and history and devote its all to the good of the people by enhancing its militant functions and role. Last year we consolidated our capabilities for self-defence and achieved a brilliant victory in the acute showdown with the imperialists. The scientists, technicians and workers in the sector of defence industry, by going beyond the cutting edge of military science with steadfast faith and mettle, demonstrated the strength of Songun Korea and rendered great services to consolidating the national defence capabilities. The officers and men of the Korean People's Army and the Korean People's Internal Security Forces, cherishing the spirit of defending their leader and motherland unto death, defended their Party and leader, country and people at the risk of their lives and smashed the reckless moves of the enemy for igniting a nuclear war and their rackets of confrontation with the DPRK at every step, thus highly exalting the dignity and might of their country. Though the circumstances were harsh and complicated last year, our service personnel and people, by pooling their efforts, achieved great successes in the struggle to build their country into an economic giant and improve the people's standard of living. An upsurge was brought about in production in several sectors and units of the national economy, and the foundations of the self-supporting economy were further consolidated. The officials and working people in the agricultural sector in particular made innovations in production even under difficult conditions and unfavourable natural climate and thus contributed to improving the people's standard of living. The service personnel and other builders set up numerous monumental structures for the prosperity of their country and well-being of their fellow people and ushered in a heyday of construction. Having turned out in response to the Party's appeal to create the ""Masikryong speed,"" they carried out many construction projects, like the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum, Unha Scientists Street, Munsu Water Park and Masikryong Ski Resort, in a short period as befitting the creations in the era of the Workers' Party by displaying burning patriotic enthusiasm and working with devotion. In this way, they showed their country's proud appearance, which is changing with each passing day, and ensured that the people's laughter of happiness could ring out louder. Those who turned out for the reclamation of the Sepho Plateau and other large-scale construction projects tamed nature, overcoming difficulties, thereby opening a breakthrough in realizing the Party's far-reaching plan at an early date. Also, the sector of culture, including sports and education, made fresh strides last year. True to the Party's intention of building our country into a sports power, a strong wind of conducting sports swept the country, and our trustworthy sportspeople won gold medals in international competitions and thus highly exalted the honour of their motherland. Preparations for enforcing a universal 12-year compulsory education were successfully promoted, many achievements made in the sector of science and technology, and up-to-date medical facilities introduced for the improvement of medical services for the people. The sector of musical art created many famous works of our times, inspiring loyalty in all the service personnel and people and encouraging them to wage a dynamic struggle and perform great feats. The shining victories and successes we achieved last year can be ascribed to the fact that the entire Party, the whole army and all the people, in support of the revolutionary and people-oriented lines and policies of our Party and its wise leadership, waged a heroic struggle with an indomitable faith and will to build a thriving socialist country without fail. Through last year's struggle we clearly demonstrated that our ideology, our strength and our way are the best and no force can check our sacred cause advancing to accomplish a far-reaching ideal and goal. I extend heartfelt thanks to all the service personnel and people, who adorned the meaningful year 2013 with eye-opening successes by displaying boundless loyalty to the Party, warm affection for their country and unparalleled self-sacrificing spirit. Comrades, The new year 2014 will be a year of grandiose struggle, a year of sea changes, in which we will raise a fierce wind of making a fresh leap forward on all fronts of building a thriving socialist country and thus usher in a golden age of Songun Korea. Our struggle of this year is a worthwhile struggle to translate the people's beautiful ideals and dreams into reality at an early date and a victors' march leading to the venue of grand festival for celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the glorious Workers' Party of Korea. In this hope-filled year we should usher in a great heyday in the revolution and construction by quickening the heroic march with enthusiasm and confidence in victory. ""Let us raise a fierce wind of making a fresh leap forward on all fronts of building a thriving country filled with confidence in victory!"" -- this is the militant slogan our Party and people should uphold this year. This year we should ensure that the sectors of agriculture, construction and science and technology hold the torch of innovations in the van and the flames of the torch flare up as flames of a leap forward on all the fronts of socialist construction. This year is a meaningful one that marks the 50th anniversary of the theses on socialist rural question made public by President Kim Il Sung. We should clearly prove the validity and vitality of the theses by waging the ideological, technological and cultural revolutions dynamically in the rural areas and bringing about a decisive turn in agricultural production. This year we should keep up agriculture as a major thrust of our effort in the struggle for economic construction and improving the people's standard of living, and concentrate all our efforts on farming. The agricultural sector should proactively introduce scientific farming methods and do farm work in a responsible manner so as to hit without fail the target of agricultural production set by the Party. It should improve animal husbandry and do greenhouse vegetable and mushroom farming on an extensive scale so as to ensure that larger quantities of meat, vegetables and mushrooms are supplied to the people. We should usher in a new heyday of construction this year. Construction is an important front for solidifying the foundations of a thriving country and creating bases for the people's happy life. The construction sector should set up world-class structures representative of the Songun era and build many other structures that could contribute to improving the people's living conditions, thus laying firm foundations of the self-supporting economy and providing the people with conditions for a more affluent and civilized life. Construction of power stations in tiers on the Chongchon River, livestock farming bases in the Sepho area, the Kosan Fruit Farm and a waterway in South Hwanghae Province and reclamation of tidal flats and other major projects should be stepped up to be completed on schedule. It is important to push ahead with the construction of dwelling houses and dormitories and construction for improving the conditions and environment for education, and set up cultural and welfare service bases on the highest standard. This year, too, the service personnel and people should make concerted efforts to build up Pyongyang so that it is more grandiose, and lay out the provinces, cities and counties so that they sustain their respective local features. Science and technology are a propellant for building a thriving country, and the happiness of the people and the future of the country hinge on their development. The scientific research sector should open a shortcut to the building of a knowledge-based economy by solving the long-term problems in developing the country's economy and improving the people's standard of living as well as scientific and technological problems arising in the actual situation and by going beyond the cutting edge. All scientists and technicians should achieve high results by skilfully riding the excellent ""steed"" provided to them by the Party and giving fullest scope to their talents and enthusiasm. By doing so, they can become true patriots who contribute to building a thriving nation. A climate of attaching importance to science and technology should prevail across society, and all officials and working people should diligently learn modern science and technology upholding the slogan of making all the people well versed in science and technology. We should raise fierce flames of innovations in the vanguard sectors, basic industrial sectors, and all other sectors of the national economy. The metallurgical and chemical industries are twin buttresses of an economic giant. Developing these industries is a major guarantee for economic construction and improving the people's standard of living. These industrial sectors should hold high the slogan of making them Juche-oriented and modern and launch a vigorous campaign for boosting production by relying on our own raw materials and fuels and on the latest science and technology. In this way they should supply sufficient amounts of steel and various kinds of chemical goods that are needed to reenergize the national economy as a whole and improve the people's standard of living. We should give definite priority to electric-power and coal-mining industries. While taking measures for generating electricity to the maximum at the existing power stations, we should draw up correct prospective plans for radically easing the strain on electricity supply and exert ourselves to carry them out. It is important to produce more electricity with priority given to hydraulic resources and by using wind, geothermal, solar and other kinds of natural energy. We should proactively increase production in coal mines and drastically solve the problem of rail and other types of transport. The electric-power and coal-mining industries and the rail transport sector should make coordinated innovations and thus give strong impetus to the development of the national economy. We should direct great efforts to developing light industry which plays a major part in improving the people's standard of living. By stepping up modernization of and introduction of CNC technology into their production lines and increasing the proportion of locally-available raw and other materials, lightindustry factories should put production on a normal footing. And all cities and counties should produce various kinds of quality consumer goods in larger amounts by developing local industry in conformity with their specific conditions. The state should take measures to bolster up the fishing sector. The sector should follow the example of the fishing sector of the People's Army that landed a huge haul of fishes by carrying out the order of the Supreme Commander unto death. By modernizing fishing vessels and implements and launching a dynamic fishing campaign by scientific methods, it should ensure that all ports resound with whistles of vessels returning with full loads. It should also conduct shallow-sea farming on an extensive scale. We should protect and increase the country's priceless natural resources including underground, forest and marine resources, and conduct an energetic mass-based tree-planting drive to cover all the mountains with thick forests. All the sectors of the national economy should increase production by tapping all potentials and latent reserves, and at the same time launch a brisk economization campaign. Economizing is precisely production and a manifestation of patriotism. We should intensify the economization campaign throughout society so as to make economical use of every watt of electricity, every gramme of coal and every drop of water. All the people should establish a habit of meticulously managing the country's economy with a high sense of patriotism and attitude as befitting masters. We should decisively improve the guidance and management of the economy. We should tighten the unified guidance of the economy by the state under the leadership of the Party, enhance the sense of responsibility and creativity of enterprises and encourage all the working people to discharge their responsibility and role as masters of production and management. We should make a big stride in the construction of culture, including education. The sector of education should improve the contents, methods, conditions and environment of education as required by the revolution and developing times and bring about a fresh turn in education, including secondary general education. By putting efforts to medical treatment and preventive medicine for promoting the people's health, the public health sector should ensure that the benefits of socialist healthcare system reach the people more closely. Art and literature are a bugler, a powerful propellant, for the revolutionary advance in building a thriving country. The sector of art and literature should produce large numbers of masterpieces of the times, which are high in ideological and artistic qualities and touch the heartstrings of the audience keeping step with the advance of our revolution and vibrant realities. We should raise more fiercely the strong wind of conducting sports throughout the country. We should encourage sportspeople to intensify training with a high ambition to become world champions, and splendidly implement the Party's plan of building our country into a sports power by developing sports science and technology and implementing the policy of making sports mass-based. We should continue to channel great efforts into building up the country's defence capabilities. Strengthening defence capabilities is the most important of all state affairs, and the country's dignity, people's happiness and peace rest on powerful arms. We should further develop the People's Army into the powerful revolutionary army of Paektusan that is unfailingly faithful to the Party, the leader, the country and the people. The main link in the whole chain of developing the People's Army is strengthening the company which is the basic combat unit of the army and base of soldiers' life. We should make all the companies elite combat ranks fully prepared politically and ideologically, militarily and technologically and their dear homes overflowing with brotherly affection. By stepping up political and ideological education among service personnel, we should train them to be strong in ideology and faith and ready to defend the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun and the Party Central Committee unto death. They should intensify combat training and launch a brisk movement for becoming crackshots so as to prepare themselves to be a-match-for-a-hundred combatants with excellent marksmanship, strong physique and a high sense of discipline. The Korean People's Internal Security Forces should creditably discharge its noble mission and duty of defending the leader, system and people by thoroughly establishing the Party's command system and revolutionary military climate in it, and the Worker-Peasant Red Guards should intensify combat training and remain fully ready for action at all times. The sector of defence industry should manufacture larger numbers of modern military hardware of our own style that are light, unmanned, intelligent and of high precision to solidify the self-defence capabilities. We should further consolidate the political and ideological position of our revolution. The political and ideological position is a fortress that decides the victory and failure in the battle of defending socialism, and consolidating the revolutionary ranks politically and ideologically is the most important task facing us. In this significant year, in which we greet the 40th anniversary of the programme of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism advanced by the great General, we should solidify the Party organizationally and ideologically, train all the members of society to be equipped with Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and cement the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks. It is imperative to establish the monolithic leadership system in the Party, definitely ensure the purity of Party ranks and improve the militant functions and role of Party organizations. We should intensify ideological education among officials, Party members and other working people to ensure that they think and act at all times and in all places in line with the Party's ideas and intentions with the steadfast faith that they know only the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and our Party. We should ensure that they approach with political awareness even the slightest phenomenon and element that infringe on the unity of the Party and revolutionary ranks and undermine their single-hearted unity, and eliminate them in a thoroughgoing way. They should wage a vigorous struggle to stamp out any sort of alien ideology and decadent lifestyle which may undermine our system and thus resolutely smash the enemy's schemes for ideological and cultural infiltration. In order to make the flames of a leap forward flare up on all fronts of building a thriving socialist country, it is crucial to give fullest play to the mental strength of the masses. The greatest potential for creation and innovation, the fundamental key to miraculous change, lies in giving play to the mental strength of all the service personnel and people. A sweeping ideological campaign for information and motivational purposes should be undertaken to give free rein to the mental strength of Party members and other working people. All of them should make Kim Jong Il's patriotism part of their mental qualities and apply it in practice, and thus become performers of heroic feats in the worthwhile struggle to build theirs into a socialist country, powerful and civilized. It is necessary to establish stringent revolutionary discipline and order in all domains of the revolutionary struggle and construction work. This is an important factor in demonstrating the advantages of collectivism of our society and making a success of all undertakings. All sectors and all units should carry out to the letter the policies of the Party and the laws, decisions and directives of the state, and encourage the officials and working people alike to observe laws, regulations and order with full awareness of being masters of our society and citizens of the DPRK. Officials should make redoubled efforts to fulfill their duty as leading members of the revolution and faithful servants of the people. They should organize undertakings in a big way with absolute loyalty to the Party, a high sense of responsibility for their work and fervent zeal, and strive with unflinching perseverance to implement the Party's plans and intentions without fail. They should regard the people's demands and interests as the absolute criteria for their performance, concern themselves only about doing things as wished by them and to their liking, and do anything in a way beneficial to them. They should be deeply sincere to people's demands and opinions, and live and work as their true servants who devote themselves to their interests at all times. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the date when President Kim Il Sung wrote his last signature on a historic document concerning the country's reunification. True to the behests of President Kim Il Sung and General Kim Jong Il, we should make fresh headway in the national reunification movement for this year. To resolve the reunification issue in keeping with the aspirations and desires of our fellow countrymen, we should reject foreign forces and hold fast to the standpoint of By Our Nation Itself. The driving force for national reunification is all the members of the Korean nation in the north, in the south and abroad; only when we remain steadfast in this standpoint can we reunify the country independently in line with our nation's interests and demands. To go on a tour around foreign countries touting for ""international cooperation"" in resolving the inter-Korean relations issue, the one related with our nation, is a humiliating treachery of leaving its destiny in the hands of outside forces. The north and the south should uphold the principle of independence which is one of the three principles for national reunification and has been confirmed in the north-south joint declarations, hold fast to the standpoint of By Our Nation Itself, and respect and implement the declarations with sincerity. We should make positive efforts to defend national security and peace. The US and south Korean war maniacs have deployed legions of equipment for a nuclear war in and around the Korean peninsula and are going frantic in their military exercises for a nuclear war against the north; this precipitates a critical situation where any accidental military skirmish may lead to an allout war. Should another war break out on this land, it will result in a deadly nuclear catastrophe and the United States will never be safe. All the Korean people must not tolerate the manoeuvres for war and confrontation by the bellicose forces at home and abroad but stoutly resist and frustrate them. A favourable climate should be established for improved relations between the north and the south. It is heartrending to see our nation partitioned by foreign forces, and it is more intolerable to see one side slinging mud at and showing hostility to the other. This will serve merely as an occasion for the forces who are undesirous of seeing one Korea to fish in troubled waters. It is high time to put an end to such slander and calumny that bring no good to both sides, and they should desist from doing anything detrimental to national unity and reconciliation. The south Korean authorities should discontinue the reckless confrontation with their compatriots and the racket against the ""followers of the north,"" and choose to promote inter-Korean relations in response to the call of the nation for independence, democracy and national reunification. We will join hands with anyone who opts to give priority to the nation and wishes for its reunification, regardless of his or her past, and continue to strive for better inter-Korean relations. All the Korean people in the north, in the south and abroad should achieve solid unity under the truly patriotic banner, the principle of By Our Nation Itself, and turn out in the nationwide struggle for the reunification of the country. By doing so, they should open up a new phase for independent reunification, peace and prosperity this year. Last year, in the international arena, the imperialists persisted in interference and war moves threatening the independence of other sovereign states and the right of mankind to existence. Especially the Korean peninsula, the hottest spot in the world, was in a hair-trigger situation due to the hostile forces' manoeuvres for a nuclear war against the DPRK, which posed a serious threat to peace and security in the region and the rest of the world. Nothing is more precious for our people than peace, but it is not something that can be achieved if we simply crave and beg for it. We can never just sit back with folded arms and see the dark clouds of a nuclear war against us hovering over the Korean peninsula. We will defend our country's sovereignty, peace and dignity by relying on our powerful self-defensive strength. Holding fast to the ideals of our foreign policy -- independence, peace and friendship -- our Party and the government of the DPRK will, in the future, too, strive to expand and develop relations of friendship and cooperation with all the countries that respect our sovereignty and are friendly to us, and safeguard global peace and security and promote common prosperity of mankind. The tasks facing us are gigantic and difficulties stand in our way. However, our revolutionary cause is sure to emerge victorious as we advance under the great banner of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. Let all of us strive for greater victory in the new year, filled with high ambition and unwavering confidence and firmly united behind the Party with a single heart.",comrade service personnel army

25.02.2014,Kim Jong-un,"At this significant time when we are marking the 40th anniversary of the proclamation by the great Comrade Kim Jong Il that modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism was the ultimate programme of our Party, we are holding the Eighth Conference of Ideological Workers of the Workers’ Party of Korea. Availing myself of this opportunity and reflecting the unanimous wish of all those attending this conference and all other members of the Party, I pay the noblest tribute to the great President Kim Il Sung, the founder and builder of the ever-victorious Workers’ Party of Korea, and to the great General Kim Jong Il, the eternal General Secretary of the Party. And on the occasion of this conference I extend, in my capacity as First Secretary of the Workers’ Party of Korea, warm thanks and militant greetings to those attending the conference and all other ideological workers of the Party and primary information workers across the country, who have worked with devotion and burning hearts at their workplaces and military posts as buglers of the revolution and pathfinders of the times. This conference held on a scale unprecedented in the history of our Party, will be a milestone and mark a radical turn in exalting for ever the brilliance of the imperishable exploits performed by the great President and the great General who, holding high the unfurled banner of the Juche idea, led the Korean revolution forward along a road resplendent with victory, in understanding and confirming once again the importance of ideological work and in launching a vigorous ideological offensive as demanded by the developing revolution. The most powerful weapon for a party that is waging a revolution shouldering the people’s destiny–in fact its one and 1 only weapon–is ideology. Without ideology, a party cannot be founded nor can it exist, and its work and revolutionary struggle are inconceivable separated from ideological work. The bloodline of the revolution is defended and the revolution advances on the strength of ideology. The one and only weapon for the Korean revolution, which started from nothing, was a great revolutionary ideology. The revolutionaries of Korea rallied their comrades and obtained weapons with their ideology; and on its strength they defeated the imperialist powers and have built a prospering socialism. We cannot see a revolution in the history of any country or of any party that, like our revolution, started out with a definite guiding ideology and has turned that ideology into a powerful force for conducting a great struggle and transformation. The whole course of the Korean revolution can be called a history of ideological work to give full play to the might of the truth of the revolutionary ideology of the President and the General. In our revolution, ideological work has always been the most important work, and a great tradition of ideological work was created in its first days. Thanks to the wise leadership of the President and the General, who gave priority to ideological work and resolved all problems by enlisting the mental strength of the masses of the people in the whole course of their leadership of the Korean revolution, the revolution inscribed only victory on its flag, even though it was blazing a new trail in history. By raising the mental strength of the service personnel and people, our Party has turned the trials decisive of victory or defeat in the revolution and its advance or setback into great upswings, and our revolution has climbed a “high mountain” whenever an upswing has been effected in ideological work. 2 The Third Conference of Ideological Workers of the Workers’ Party of Korea, which was held 40 years ago and at which the great General proclaimed that modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism is the ultimate programme of our Party, is of special importance in the history of our Party, as it opened a pivotal phase of the revolution on the strength of ideology. That the General defined Kimilsungism as the guiding ideology of our Party and proclaimed that modelling the whole society on that ideology is the ultimate programme of our Party, was a political event that clearly indicated the road for bringing closer the final victory in the Korean revolution and roused all the service personnel and people to achieving it. The historic advance to model the whole society on Kimilsungism gave birth to a powerful political General Staff that achieved oneness in ideology and leadership for the first time in the history of building a revolutionary party, to invincible revolutionary armed forces that march with the red flag of the Workers’ Party as its leading standard, and to militant ranks united single-heartedly. History clearly shows how a powerful country which is independent, self-sufficient and self-reliant in national defence has been built on this land where once the worship of big countries and dogmatism were deeply rooted and a socialist fortress created which remains unperturbed in the face of worldwide political upheavals and the imperialists’ vicious moves to isolate and suffocate it. Today mankind is studying the great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism so as to find the road ahead of them. Everywhere on the globe the ideology centred on the masses, the revolutionary theory of independence, has become the spirit and banner of struggle for people who aspire after genuine freedom and happiness. Endless is the glory our service personnel and people enjoy 3 for having waged the revolution for scores of years along the road indicated by the great ideology and in a country which is admired by the whole world and which gave birth to the ideology guiding the era of independence. To hasten the final victory of the Korean revolution, holding high the banner of the great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism, is their faith and will and the wish of the times and history. We must hold aloft modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism as the ultimate programme of the Party and accomplish the Korean revolution without fail on the strength of ideology, on the strength of single-hearted unity. The standard-bearers in the effort to model the entire Party and the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism are ideological workers. Success not only in transforming all the members of society into advocates of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism but also in transforming all realms of social life as required by Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism depends on the success of ideological work. You should once again reflect on the deep reason why the General convened the conference of ideological workers and proclaimed in front of Party information workers from across the country the programme of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism. We should spark a struggle on the Party’s ideological front first and heighten the intensity of ideological work so as to markedly quicken the onward march of our revolution to model the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. We have rich experience of forcefully propelling the historic march to model the whole society on Kimilsungism by dint of an intensive ideological offensive, and we also have powerful forces and means of information and motivation work with which to stir up the whole country all at once. 4 To hasten the final victory of the revolution by holding higher the ideological theory of Juche, a powerful weapon–this is the main spirit of this conference. In view of the demands of the reality when modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism poses itself as the general task in the ideological work of our Party, the Party Central Committee has presented to the Eighth Conference of Ideological Workers of the Workers’ Party of Korea the slogan, “Let us hasten final victory through a revolutionary ideological offensive!” In the firm belief that all those attending this conference and other ideological workers throughout the Party, aware of the honour and responsibility of being ideological standard-bearers in accomplishing the cause of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism, will give full play to the strength of our Party’s revolutionary ideology and the inexhaustible mental strength of all the service personnel and people, I would like to speak about some problems facing the Party in its ideological work at present. First of all, we should concentrate all our efforts in the Party’s ideological work on firmly establishing the Party’s monolithic leadership system. The objective of our effort to establish the Party’s monolithic leadership system across the Party and society is to consolidate the unity and cohesion of the Party, the political General Staff of the revolution, and its fighting efficiency in all aspects, implement the instructions of the President and the General to the letter, and realize our people’s dreams and ideals as soon as possible. Now is a crucial period when we must break through the ordeals facing the revolution by rallying the service personnel and people more firmly around the Party and channel all their 5 patriotic enthusiasm, wisdom and resourcefulness into stepping up the building of a thriving country. The ideological system and leadership system for carrying out this historic task scrupulously and perfectly is none other than the Party’s monolithic leadership system. The ideological work of our Party must naturally proceed from its basic task in the present period, and the main effort must be directed to implementing it. However, Party organizations are now revealing a tendency to pay only lip service to the work of establishing the Party’s monolithic leadership system, and to engross themselves in paperwork in this regard. Although a Party-wide discussion of the documents on establishing the Party’s monolithic leadership system was conducted and many study sessions, public lectures and oath-taking meetings held, Party organizations failed to detect and crush in advance the modern version of a factionalist group which had formed within the Party. Although our Party has its great revolutionary ideology and absolutely correct lines and policies, its organizations and excellent people, a factionalist group recently appeared within the Party. Our ideological workers are partly to blame for this. This modern version of a factionalist group was an ideologically degenerate entity which was outwardly overwhelmed with fear in the face of the pressure from the imperialists and inwardly contaminated with bourgeois ideology and culture. The factionalist practice of challenging the Party’s monolithic leadership system originates in ideological degeneration, and the renegades of ideology are bound to oppose the Party and the revolution in the long run. Imbuing the Party and the revolutionary ranks with one 6 ideology–this is the seed and core of the effort to establish the Party’s monolithic leadership system. The objective of the revolutionary ideological offensive for establishing the Party’s monolithic leadership system is to make the great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and its embodiment, the Party’s lines and policies, an unshakeable conviction among the masses of the people. The revolutionary ideology of our Party has always accorded with the aspirations and demands of the masses, and there is no line or policy of the Party which they cannot understand and accept. A breakthrough should be made in the ideological offensive by raising across the Party another strong wind of studying the immortal works of the President and the General and the documents of the Party, a library of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. These works and documents are excellent textbooks for the education in the one and only ideology and a great encyclopaedia explaining our Party’s lines and policies. If they study them in a chronological order and in a systematic way, Party members, other working people and service personnel can equip themselves firmly with the Juche idea, the Songun idea, Kim Jong Il’s patriotism, the revolutionary traditions of our Party and class awareness, and fully understand any new lines and policies advanced by the Party. It is important to conduct education work in a scrupulous manner so that all are well-versed in the instructions the President and the General gave to their own individual sectors and units and the Party’s policies, and make them a creed in their work and life. You need to explain to the masses the Party’s policies for a given period in a logical and convincing way so that they empathize with them and accept them as their own. You should 7 focus on informing people in simple terms about things they are eager to know and hear on the basis of the Party’s policies and in the same way that you would tell a thirsty person where he or she can find water to drink. In the future, if everybody at a unit is as well informed of the Party’s lines and policies as they are of their family affairs, the unit will be considered to have conducted ideological work effectively and to have established the monolithic leadership system. “Exceptions” must never be permitted in ideological work. The fact is that even a rolling stone may gather moss; so, one is bound to degenerate when afforded exceptional treatment. There may be some special tasks assigned by the Party, but within our Party there cannot exist “exceptions” who are allowed to neglect their ideological life and be ignorant of its lines and policies. In the case of special units, ideological work should be strengthened further and they should be rendered as strong as steel in the furnace of ideological struggle. Ideological workers should be able to discern at a glance if there is something alien in the eyes of others. They must use the ideological “scalpel” promptly to root out the causes of such misdemeanours as arguing over issues decided by the Party, undermining its leadership exploits covertly or overtly and breeding corruption within our ranks in contravention of our Party’s and class principles. It is important to conduct the work of imbuing the Party and the revolutionary ranks with one ideology in close combination with the practical struggle. A person’s ideology is expressed in practice and its outcome, rather than in revolutionary rhetoric or pledges. The man, who, although he seldom speaks, carries out the plans and decisions of the Party Central Committee according to the set timetable and at 8 the standard demanded by it, is one who is armed with the Party’s ideology as an element of his faith. Endeavouring to implement the ideology of the Party and champion its policies–this is the clearest manifestation of one’s loyalty to it and important for making the validity of its lines and policies an element of one’s faith. The soldier-builders who successfully carried out the project at Masik Pass last year were determined to wage a death-defying struggle not to delay even for a moment the completion date proclaimed to the world by the Party Central Committee; they performed a miraculous feat by completing in one year a project which was estimated to take ten, thus staunchly defending the prestige of the Party. The on-site political work of the People’s Army, which was three-dimensional and offensive-style ideological work to inspire everyone from generals to private soldiers with a single desire to carry out their Supreme Commander’s order, serves as a good example in the ideological offensive to establish the Party’s monolithic leadership system. In implementing the instructions of the President and the General, the Party’s new line of developing the two fronts simultaneously and Party policies, all sectors and all units should conduct an ideological analysis and review of their failures and their causes. Then they should press on with the frontline-style information and motivation campaign to learn from the service personnel’s spirit of carrying out their tasks even if it costs them their lives. The main targets of the ideological offensive for establishing the Party’s monolithic leadership system are the misguided ideological viewpoint and work attitude of the officials who give verbal support to the Party’s policies but do not implement them instantly. 9 We must combat the ideological maladies of those officials who remain indifferent to the obstacles lying in the way of implementing the Party’s policies for their own sectors, units and regions, as well as to the difficulties facing the people in their everyday lives. The ideological education and ideological campaign aimed at rooting out such undesirable ideological elements as defeatism, self-preservation, formalism, expediency, irresponsibility and self-centredness should be conducted, based on an appropriate methodology. The information and organization sectors of the Party should be scrupulous in working in close cooperation with each other, while the ideological campaign should be combined with legal action to maximize its efficiency. The soaring mental spirit of our service personnel and people who, after liquidating the modern version of a factionalist group, have hardened their resolve to follow the Party Central Committee invariably along the long road of revolution, should be fanned to flare up into the flames of a great revolutionary upsurge. Historically speaking, the great victory was won in the Fatherland Liberation War after the purge of an anti-Party, counterrevolutionary factionalist clique following the Fifth Plenary Meeting of the Party Central Committee; the Chollima upswing was brought about in the course of eliminating the August 1956 factionalist group; and world-startling successes were achieved in the showdown with the United States and in the socialist industrialization drive after the anti-Party revisionists were exposed and purged at the 15th Plenary Meeting of the Fourth Party Central Committee. On its ideological front the Party should actively encourage all Party members and other working people to follow in their forerunners’ footsteps and become standard-bearers and 10 meritorious workers in the struggle to champion the Party Central Committee by bringing about a revolutionary upsurge. If all our service personnel and people, rallied firmly around the Party, make substantial progress in socialist construction, those who are wavering due to a lack of confidence will be brought to their senses and the monolithic leadership system of the Party will be established solidly across the Party and society. Another important task facing our Party in its ideological work is to raise a strong wind of an ideological campaign to boost the struggle for defending socialism. In the present era, as in the past, socialism represents the ideal of humanity, and it is the irreversible trend of the times. We are now following an untrodden historical path staking the dignity of our independent people and the destiny of socialism in the struggle to repulse the imperialists’ frantic attacks. Today the path of socialism and the inevitability of its victory depend on the struggle of Korea’s revolutionaries. In performing this honourable mission our Party and people have assumed before history, the ideological workers, the red, hardcore elements of the Party, should become undying torchlight and loud bugles. They should give Party members and other working people a clear understanding of the essence and character of the present struggle to defend socialism. In the struggle we waged in defence of socialism in the 1990s, we created a historic miracle of safeguarding our ideology and system against the allied imperialist forces’ moves to isolate and stifle our country. The ongoing struggle to defend socialism can be said to be aimed at prevailing over imperialism in all fields of social life by consolidating the victories and successes achieved so far and giving full play to the advantages and might of socialism. 11 Recently, our Party has put forward both the agricultural and the scientific fronts as outposts for defending socialism. Its intention is to constantly remind our people that not only on the frontline where guns are levelled at each other but also in all other places where they live, they are engaged in an invisible, fierce confrontation and competition with the imperialists. If we, resting on our laurels and praising ourselves, do not give spur to the revolution and construction and thus fail to bring the people real benefits, such socialism is doomed to lose its appeal. We should build a thriving country as soon as possible by giving full play to the advantages and might of socialism, which capitalism can never imitate nor possess, so as to make socialism as different in all respects from capitalism as heaven is from earth. A vigorous ideological campaign should be launched to demonstrate the might of our great army-people unity on a higher level in building a thriving country. The solid single-hearted unity of the army and people around the Party constitutes the cornerstone of our style of socialism and a great foundation in building a thriving nation. The successive eye-opening miracles which have been wrought recently, shaking the land, mountains and rivers throughout the country, are all the fruits of the great unity between the service personnel and people and of their concerted efforts. The People’s Army should, in the future, too, be the prime mover and pioneer in strengthening this great army-people unity. It should intensify its information and motivation work geared to giving full play to the might of an army that is strong in ideology both in national defence and socialist construction. The Party organizations and political organs in the army should regularly create such new terms as the “Masikryong speed” by carrying forward the proud history of the revolutionary army which has 12 proved with its indomitable revolutionary spirit that Korea’s determination is its materialization and reality, and civilian Party organizations should accelerate the work of learning from the revolutionary spirit and fighting style of the service personnel. When the time comes for us to wage an all-out life-and-death fight with the enemy, we can achieve final victory on the strength of the great army-people unity, all-people resistance, based on the revolutionary soldier spirit. All sectors and all units should launch a dynamic ideological offensive so as to make the flames of collective innovation flare up. Our people gained valuable experience in ushering in a golden age of socialist construction through an all-people, collective innovation movement in the 1970s, a decade of great change. In the 1970s, when the country was resounding with the drumbeats of revolution and the bugles sounding the speed campaign, they made magnificent creations and changes unprecedented in the history of their country, while militarily coping with the large-scale war exercises staged by the US imperialists. It was during those days that our country became the first in the world to abolish the tax system, enforced universal 11-year compulsory education and rendered massive assistance to the developing countries and the fighting peoples around the world. It is the intention of our Party to carry on the building of an economic giant and a civilized state by bringing into play the might of socialism, the might of collectivism, as happened in the 1970s. The flames of the movement to win the title of O Jung Hup-led 7th Regiment and the three-revolution red flag movement should flare up more fiercely in military and civilian units, and 13 vigorous socialist emulation drives be launched in sectors, units and regions and by stages. By so doing, we can ensure that a strong wind of collective competition sweeps the whole country. For the present our Party demands that all military and civilian sectors create model units and, with them providing the initial spark, kindle the flames of joint innovation. Ideological workers should focus on enlisting the creative zeal and activeness of the masses both in creating units that advance ahead of the times and in organizing competition for overtaking them. The ideological campaign against the abuse of authority and bureaucratism should be stepped up to make all officials rallying points that, sharing weal and woe with the masses, unite their collectives, as well as dependable point-men in the mass innovation movement. Efforts should be channelled into information and motivation work for bringing into full play the spirit of self-reliance, the might of which has been fully demonstrated in the severe trials of history. We can say that the whole history of socialism of our own style boils down to self-reliance. In the days of building socialism by their own efforts, our Party and people underwent unprecedented ordeals and difficulties, and they were ultimately loaded with all sorts of honours our nation could not enjoy in its history spanning thousands of years. Had we succumbed to the pressure from outside forces and abandoned the principle of self-reliance, Juche-oriented socialism would not have been born and our country’s name would have disappeared along with the collapse of the worldwide socialist system. On the track of self-reliance Chollima rose up on the ruins of war and the miracle was achieved of manufacturing and launching an earth satellite and becoming a nuclear state, a miracle of great significance in the national history. 14 Ideological workers should intensify among officials and working people education by means of the history of our socialist construction, so as to implant in them the belief that self-reliance is the path of building a thriving nation. Self-reliance is the spirit of national self-sustenance and the spirit of going beyond the cutting edge to lead the whole world by our own efforts, with our own resources and with our own technology. We need to steadily build on the fighting spirit with which we made tractors and electric locomotives from scratch and the spirit with which we conquered space by our own efforts and with our own technology. We should undertake an information and motivation offensive to ensure that everyone turns out in the campaign to make everything in our country the assets of socialism that cannot be found elsewhere in the world, fully conscious that they must go beyond the cutting edge even at their own posts and workplaces. We should provide ideological support for the efforts to make a breach in the imperialists’ manoeuvring to monopolize high technology, and should create advanced science and technology of our own. It is important to be active in encouraging scientists and technicians firmly to defend their revolutionary positions on the grand march of self-reliance led by the locomotive called “science and technology.” Ideological workers should play a major role in creating a climate in which the importance of science is recognized throughout society and in which all people are made well-versed in science and technology. We must launch an information offensive in which, ideologically and morally, we overpower the imperialist reactionary forces who are trying to stamp out socialism. The imperialists are currently hell-bent on a smear campaign to turn black into white and are persisting in their attempts to infiltrate corrupt reactionary ideology and culture into our 15 country with our service personnel and young people as the target; at the same time they are still manoeuvring to apply sanctions against our country, and stifle it. Whereas reactionary ideology and culture were their guide to aggression in the past, they are playing a leading role in their aggression at present. The struggle to defend socialism should be an offensive operation to, outwardly, gain the political and ideological upper hand over the imperialists who are hindering our onward movement and, inwardly, sweep up non-socialist practices and decadent ideology and culture by means of our revolutionary ideology and culture. Ideological workers should undermine the enemy’s morale by launching a skilful media campaign, a radio campaign, aimed at giving wide publicity to the validity of our ideology and cause and at laying bare the vulnerability and foul nature of the imperialists. They should make larger numbers of ideological “missiles” capable of severely damaging the enemy and instilling firm confidence in victory among our service personnel and people. They should take the initiative in launching operations to thwart the imperialists’ moves for ideological and cultural infiltration, while putting up double and treble “mosquito nets” to prevent the viruses of capitalist ideology which the enemy is persistently attempting to spread, from crossing our border. By nature, the working masses reject the bourgeois ideology and culture which preach the money-is-almighty principle and the law of the jungle. We need to create and propagate larger numbers of wholesome and revolutionary works of art and literature, articles and presentations of our own style which highlight the beautiful dreams and ideals of the masses and which brim over with national flavour, so as to encourage our people to turn their backs on bourgeois ideology and culture of their own 16 accord. Decisive steps should be taken to use the Internet as a medium for giving publicity to our ideology and culture in order to cope with the enemy’s moves to propagate their reactionary ideology and culture by misusing mankind’s latest scientific and technological achievements. The sector of ideological work and the related units should work out detailed plans for putting the mass media and external publicity means on a modern and IT basis, and make persevering efforts to implement them. The Party’s ideological work should be conducted in an aggressive manner. Our Party’s strategy and tactics in ideological work are to encourage the whole country to seethe and make a revolutionary leap forward by fanning the flames of the ideological offensive so that they flare up fiercely, in the spirit of advancing against all odds. The ideological position of our Party should be established in the form for attack, not for defence. We should also conduct ideological education aimed at imbuing the whole society with the red ideology of the Workers’ Party in a proactive way, conduct political work aimed at calling forth the mental strength of all the service personnel and people as it is done on the front line, and conduct the struggle to sweep away all shades of evil ideas at lightning speed. In order to conduct ideological work in an aggressive manner, it is necessary, above all, to root out the defeatist outlook revealed among ideological workers. Ideological workers who are infected with such an outlook cannot take even a single step by themselves even if they are placed in the vanguard of the ideological offensive. The “Yongil bomb spirit” created in the forests of Mt. Paektu and the do-or-die resistance spirit of Xiaowangqing and 17 Chechangzi did not emerge in ordinary times, and the legend of Chollima, the miracles of the speed campaign, the revolutionary soldier spirit and the Kanggye spirit were not born under more favourable circumstances than at present. Comrades, Defeatism in ideological work is more dangerous than that in economic work. The present ideological offensive must start with eliminating defeatism from among ideological workers. Those engaged in ideological work in the birthplace of the Juche idea must not wait for a miracle to occur, but go purposefully among the people, carrying with them the weapon of ideology, and become active doers and devoted creators who find solutions. The posts in national defence, at factories, in farm villages and in other places where you are working bear the imprints of examples of the outstanding art of leadership set by the peerlessly great men who found in the simple opinions of the service personnel and people the best method of turning misfortune into blessing and adversity into prosperity. If you work with the history of the revolutionary leadership of the President and the General as your textbook, you will find nothing you cannot understand and overcome in your work, and our Party’s ideological work will truly become an initial spark for kindling the flames of a leap forward. In order to ensure the success of the revolutionary ideological offensive, we should fire an opening salvo of an ideological campaign and make our fire concentrated, regular and accurate. First of all, by enlisting all the forces and means already provided for information and motivation purposes, you should conduct ideological work in a flexible and intensive manner. When the Party puts forward a new line or policy, all the networks of education, public lectures and motivation work, as 18 well as the mass media, should be mobilized promptly to inform all the people, ranging from officials at the central organs to farmers in remote, mountainous villages. The contents, forms, means and methods of ideological work should, to all intents and purposes, be geared and subordinated to carrying out revolutionary tasks. The forces and means of information and motivation work should be concentrated on those projects the Party attaches importance to, thus kindling the fire of a fresh leap forward. Ideological work should also, by giving uninterrupted publicity to the Party’s intentions and leading a continuous advance in the ideological struggle, ensure that no shades of evil ideas ever make inroads into our ranks. This can be likened to removing falling snow from a runway with a snow blower to prevent it from piling up. Ideological work should not be a flash in the pan or conducted with everyone standing on ceremony, but done regularly regardless of the time and place, so that people can imbibe the Party’s ideas the way they breathe air. A ceaseless and intensive ideological campaign should be conducted to sweep away alien ideological trends and lifestyles. And the repetition of stereotyped speeches and methods should be strictly guarded against. It is also important to select the right targets of the ideological offensive based on an understanding of preparedness, characteristics and ideological tendencies, and apply appropriate means and methods. President Kim Il Sung said that work with people should be conducted in the way a mother does, who talks differently when teaching her eldest son and youngest son. If the employees of their units number ten thousand, ideological workers should know the inner thoughts of each of them and work with them using ten thousand methods. 19 The path of our revolution is not smooth, and every revolutionary front requires genuine and well-qualified ideological workers who cherish the staunch revolutionary spirit. In fact, we have a vast force of Party information workers and primary information workers enrolled in the networks of education, public lectures and motivation work. They number tens of thousands. If they are well prepared we can form an elite corps and with such a contingent, we will have nothing to fear and nothing will be beyond our strength. Among his revolutionary soldiers, the great General treasured and loved most dearly those who defended the ideological front, and led and encouraged them at every step, saying that a film or an article is as powerful as several thousand tons of food grain or tens of thousands of artillery shells. Our Party’s ideological workers have assumed a heavy task. Each of them should become strong in ideas and faith, someone whom the enemy fear more than they do an entire division or corps. Although simple and modest in appearance, their hearts are always burning with the Party’s intentions and they enthusiastically support the revolution and struggle–this is a feature our Party thinks ideal for information workers. Ideological workers should be true revolutionaries who never abandon the Party’s principle of ideological work, whatever the adversity. They should have the passion to cover long distances in a single night to inform people of the Party’s intentions and to burn the midnight oil for several days in studying the Party’s policies and learning knowledge and technology. Having a proper outlook on people is a vital requirement for ideological workers, who must make them open their minds. Our Party’s information workers should be true sons and daughters of the people who learn from them before teaching 20 them and who highly appreciate their efforts. To this end, they should first remember, whenever they approach them, that they are standing before the great people whom the President and the General believed in as in heaven and regarded as their teachers throughout their lives. Love and respect for the labouring people emanate from the spirit of loving labour. Our officials should mingle with the masses, their hands stained with grease and their shoes with earth, and be proud of doing so. The President and the General performed great exploits for the people throughout their lives, while keeping nothing back for themselves. Regarding the ideas and trust of the Party as their wealth, ideological workers should find the worth of living in informing as many people as possible of the Party’s policies and ensuring that collective innovations are brought about at the units under their charge. A genuine ideological worker is someone who values more than gold the excitement he or she feels whenever people are eager to be informed of the Party’s intentions and when they support the Party’s policies whole-heartedly. When the Party’s intentions are passed on and revolutionary songs and cheering for the Workers’ Party and socialism resound wherever our Party’s ideological workers go, it will be a great encouragement to the Party. The entire Party should become information and motivational workers, and all officials should conduct political work. Whether they are Party, administrative, economic or primary officials, they should regard it as the key to stimulate the mental strength of the masses, and direct due efforts to it. In particular, chief secretaries of provincial, city and county Party committees and senior Party officials in all sectors and all units should place 21 ideological work under their personal control and conduct it with all sincerity and with great efforts. In the 1970s all officials, under the leadership of the Party, used to go down to their subordinate units with rucksacks on their backs like the anti-Japanese guerrillas had done, rouse people as required by the Chongsan-ri spirit and Chongsan-ri method and bring about innovations. This vibrant spirit should prevail throughout the country. Comrades, The revolutionary tasks facing us are enormous and the situation remains as severe as ever. However, we should make a leap forward to bring the future closer and achieve a ceaseless advance through our struggle. As soon as you leave this conference venue, you should go among the service personnel and people to inform them of the intentions of the Party Central Committee and take up your starting positions for the ideological offensive with a fresh determination. I stress once again: The more vibrantly the ideological front seethes, the more fully the mental strength of the masses will be demonstrated, and the more the service personnel and people are roused, the faster the revolution will advance. I firmly believe that all our ideological workers, including those attending this conference, will become political workers of the type of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il who make the whole country seethe and transform the entire army along revolutionary lines, thus hastening our final victory.",significant mark anniversary proclamation jong model society kimilsungism ultimate

18.09.2014,Kim Jong-un,"The Fourth Conference of Primary Officials of Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League is being held when the yearning for the great General Kim Jong Il and the pledge of loyalty to remain steadfast to the Party are surging in the hearts of young people across the country on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the publication of his letter to those attending the conference of model primary officials of the youth league. I extend my warm congratulations to those attending this conference and other primary officials of the youth league across the country who, upholding the Party’s idea of giving prominence to young people, are working with devotion to build up the organizations of the youth league and train young people into a young vanguard that is unfailingly loyal to our Party. The great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il loved young people most and showed great concern for the work with them throughout their lives. Having launched his revolutionary activities by going among young people and rallying them as comrades sharing weal and woe with one another in the struggle, President Kim Il Sung created the original idea of giving prominence to young people and, by applying this idea, prepared them as a powerful vanguard for the revolution and a reliable reserve force for the Party. General Kim Jong Il carried forward this idea, handing over the torch of the revolution to young people, naming the youth league after the President and leading them to fulfil with credit the mission and duty they had assumed for the times and the revolution. Under the wise leadership of the President and the General and their benevolent care, our young people have travelled a road covered with glory, adorning the decades of the revolution with heroic exploits and proud victories. 1 The young people of the first generation of the Korean revolution, holding high Comrade Kim Il Sung as the sun of the nation, waged a bloody struggle against the Japanese imperialists and accomplished the historic cause of national liberation; in doing so they set a shining example in defending the leader to the death. During the fierce Fatherland Liberation War, which was decisive of the country’s destiny, those who were brought up under his personal care fought heroically, shouting, “Long live General Kim Il Sung!” thus bringing about the July 27 victory. In the postwar period of socialist construction they took the lead in realizing the intentions of their Party and leader and performed world-startling feats in the difficult and demanding sectors, thereby demonstrating the heroic mettle of Chollima Korea. In the years of the Arduous March and forced march our dependable young men and women overcame unprecedented hardships with the firm conviction that they would share their destiny with the General to the last, demonstrating to the whole world the invincible might of Songun Korea in the struggle for safeguarding socialism and in the showdown with the United States. The heroic, immortal exploits our young people performed in the trying decades of the revolution have been recorded in history, illustrating the precious truth that the key to victory in the revolution, the nation’s prosperity and the worthwhile life of young people lie in holding the leader in high esteem and supporting his ideas and leadership faithfully. The traditions of the death-defying defence of the leader and of heroic struggle which our young people created and have upheld in the past decades of the revolution are an invaluable revolutionary legacy and eternal banner of victory that they should pass on from one generation to the next. The present is an era of dynamic struggle, a new era of the Juche revolution, in which all the service personnel and other people, under 2 the leadership of our Party, have turned out in a general offensive to achieve final victory in the revolution, holding aloft the great banner of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. Single-heartedly united around the Party, they are struggling vigorously in high spirits to make leaps forward and effect innovations in all sectors of the revolution and construction in order to achieve the goal of developing theirs into a thriving socialist country. Our Party demands that young people, the successors to the Songun revolution, lead the historic march in the new era. The youth league is a reliable advance group and wing of our Party in the struggle to carry out the revolutionary cause of Songun. The young people of the present era assume the sacred and honourable duty of raising on the peak of final victory the red flag of the revolution which is permeated with the precious blood and sweat of the revolutionary forerunners and associated with their ennobling desires. For us, no difficulty is insurmountable and no goal is unattainable when the young people, who have been raised in the embrace of the great leaders and the great Party and tempered in the flames of the Songun revolution, achieve breakthroughs in the vanguard of the struggle. They should creditably play their role as the young vanguard of the Party by devoting their youthful strength, wisdom and passion in the ongoing historic march, in the same way that they have always responded heartily to the requirements of the Party and the revolution and the call of the country. “Young people, be vanguard fighters who are unfailingly faithful to the Party’s revolutionary cause of Songun!”–this is the militant slogan to be upheld by our young people. Young people should loyally support the Party’s leadership. The Party’s leadership is the lifeblood of our young men and women. It is only under the Party’s leadership that they can staunchly 3 carry forward the lineage of Paektu and the revolutionary cause of Juche and successfully fulfil their honourable mission and duty as the young vanguard of the Songun era. With the unshakeable conviction that they support our Party alone, they should trust and follow it with a pure heart and advance vigorously along the road indicated by it. Young people should become a bulwark and shield defending our Party to the death. They should glorify every moment on the road of defending the Party, even at the cost of their lives, following the noble examples of the revolutionary forerunners who sacrificed their youth and lives unhesitatingly for the Party and the leader. They should be vanguard fighters in the campaign to implement the ideas of the Party and champion its policies. They should cherish the ideas and policies of the Party as an element of their firm faith, think and act at all times and in all places in conformity with its ideas and intentions, and carry out its policies thoroughly, in the spirit of regarding them as absolute and implementing them unconditionally. By modelling themselves after the soldier spirit and work style of the People’s Army that executes the Supreme Commander’s orders without hesitation and at the highest level, they must thoroughly implement the Party’s policies by the time set and at the level demanded by it. Young people should be a death-defying corps defending their socialist country. National defence is the highest expression of patriotism and the most sacred duty of young people. The young people of the Songun era should regard it as the greatest honour to be at the forefront in safeguarding the country with arms and perform with credit the duty their generation has assumed for the country, as those victors in the great years defeated the US aggressors by 4 laying down their only youth for the sake of their only motherland. The service personnel of the People’s Army who, as the soldiers of the Supreme Commander, guard their posts in arms, should make their training more intensive, just as the antiJapanese guerrillas did on Mt. Paektu. By doing so they should prepare themselves into a-match-for-a-hundred combatants who are armed fully with the Juche-oriented military ideas and brimming over with the spirit of a warrior. They should maintain full combat readiness, always thinking of the battlefield, and display to the full the valour of the young people of Songun Korea in the event of a decisive battle against the enemy. Young people should acquire the traits of loving weapons and giving importance to military affairs. All young people, their hearts burning with the will to annihilate the enemy, should participate in military training with all sincerity and make full preparations for combat mobilization, thereby staunchly defending their streets, villages, factories, farms and schools. They should take an active part in physical training for national defence, highly display the traits of aiding the army and give full play to the beautiful traits of respecting and helping the war veterans and disabled soldiers. They should resolutely smash the imperialist moves to infiltrate us ideologically and culturally. The enemy are infiltrating corrupt recordings and publications into our country and widely propagating all sorts of viruses of corrupt ideology in an attempt to make our young people ideologically degenerate and alienate them from our Party. The main target of the enemy’s manoeuvres for ideological and cultural infiltration is our young people of a new generation. If the young people succumb, it cannot be interpreted otherwise than as an act of betrayal and treachery to the Party and revolution and benefiting the enemy. They should have a clear understanding of the true nature of the 5 enemy’s moves for ideological and cultural infiltration and their danger, never become involved in such acts, and resolutely frustrate any involvement by always standing alert to them and combating them. They should staunchly oppose and reject delinquent and all other non-socialist practices that tarnish the image of socialism and undermine our system. Young people should be a vanguard detachment and a shock brigade in building a thriving socialist country. Building a thriving socialist country is a worthwhile struggle to make the country, which has been defended at the cost of people’s blood, more prosperous and translate the beautiful ideals of the people into reality, and it is the greatest honour and pride of the young people of the present era to perform proud feats in this struggle. Young people should be standard-bearers in creating the Korean speed in building an economic giant. They should volunteer to work at labour-consuming and difficult sites where an economic giant is being built and make breakthroughs for the advance. They should speed up and complete the construction of the Paektusan Songun Youth Power Station and the reconstruction of the Northern Railways and perform laudable exploits at various sites of grandiose nature-remaking and construction projects. Young people should regard the national economic plans assigned to them as a combat mission entrusted by the country, implement them at all costs and without fail, and kindle the fierce flames of increased production, thus constantly creating new norms and records. Young people should be the vanguard in the effort to go beyond the cutting edge of science and technology. With the great ambition to beat the world as the scientists who developed satellites and demonstrated the might of Songun Korea did, young people should wage vigorous competitions of the mind and of technologies, and 6 thereby give a powerful stimulus to the building of a thriving country by means of their excellent achievements in science and technology. They should turn out in the youth science and technology campaign to give full play to their creative intelligence and talents, be well versed in the technologies in their sectors and win fame as masters of invention and technical conception. Young people should take an active part in the Songun Youth Torch Prize movement, youth shock brigade movement, youth workteam movement and other mass-based movements and display their youthful resourcefulness and gallantry to the full. They should stand in the vanguard of the struggle to usher in a heyday of a civilized socialist nation. The young people in the sector of art and literature should give full play to their creativity and conduct intensive revolutionary creation, thus producing a cascade of masterpieces of the era that are loved by the masses. Young people should learn from the revolutionary soldier culture so as to establish a noble cultural and emotional way of life and always live optimistically and joyfully by actively conducting mass-based cultural and artistic activities. They should take the lead in making sports mass-based and part of daily life and, upholding the Party’s plan of building our country into a sports power, sweat more in training in order to bring glory to the country by winning gold medals. They should participate with an attitude befitting masters in the effort to establish a cultured way of production and life, thereby improving their workplaces so that they become palaces and their streets and villages, a socialist paradise. Upholding the slogan of making all the people well-informed about science and technology, young people should diligently learn modern science and technology and thus become fullfledged masters of the era of the knowledge economy. They should make it their daily routine and habit to read books. They should all be enthusiastic and diligent learners and read books on 7 various fields including Party literature, books dedicated to revolutionary education, and science and technology books. They should read every issue of the Chongnyon Jonwi newspaper. The students are the pillars of a prosperous Korea who will take charge of its future as a scientific and technological giant, a talented nation. They should study hard, nurturing an ambition to become world-startling scientists and doctors in their twenties and thirties and take an active part in production internships and various socio-political activities, thus fully preparing themselves as able revolutionary workers possessed of theoretical and practical abilities and versatile skills. The position and role of the primary organizations of the youth league are very important in ensuring that young people creditably fulfil their honourable mission as the young vanguard of the Party in the new era. The primary organizations of the youth league are the bases of young people’s political life and basic combat units which rally the masses of young people around the Party and organize and mobilize them to implement its policies. Their organizing ability, united force and combat efficiency are precisely those of the youth league. However, they are failing to discharge their role satisfactorily in line with their important position and mission as the political organizations of young people. Some are failing to focus on the guidance of their members’ organizational and ideological life, their basic duty, and do not work in conformity with the feelings, psychology and sentiments of young people as befitting young people’s organizations. Strengthening the primary organizations and enhancing their role constitutes the first step in consolidating the youth league itself and a major link in the whole chain of developing the youth movement. This is why our Party gives importance to the conference of primary 8 officials of the youth league and expects that this conference will be an epoch-making occasion in strengthening the grass-roots organizations of the youth league and thus fully training young people into the vanguard who faithfully support the Party’s Songunbased revolutionary leadership. Keeping the importance of the work of the youth league and the high expectations of the Party deep in their minds, those attending this conference and other officials of the youth league should radically enhance the militant functions and role of the primary organizations of the youth league so as to usher in a new heyday of the youth movement in the Songun era. The primary organizations of the youth league should intensify their members’ organizational and ideological life as required by the developing revolution. Whether or not young people are trained as vanguard fighters of the Songun revolution who continue the march started on Mt. Paektu arm in arm, shoulder to shoulder, with the leader depends entirely on how the primary organizations of the youth league organize and guide their organizational and ideological life. It is of paramount importance that they should direct the main effort to intensifying their members’ organizational and ideological life. First of all, they should conduct brisk ideological education among young people. It is important in the ideological education of young people at present to intensify education in Kim Jong Il’s patriotism, faith, class awareness and morality. Kim Jong Il’s patriotism is the most valuable nutriment in bringing up the new generation as genuine patriots who love the country and the people and a powerful stimulant for encouraging young people to strive to build a thriving country. The primary organizations of the youth league should inform young people, through actual facts, of the undying exploits of General Kim Jong Il 9 who, always cherishing the country and the people in his mind, continued to follow the road of love for his country and people throughout his life. By doing so, they should encourage them to cherish Kim Jong Il’s patriotism as an element of their disposition and become true patriots who love their home villages and workplaces and are ready to devote themselves in response to the call of the country and the people. Revolution means faith and a person devoid of faith cannot become a revolutionary. Only those with firm revolutionary faith can follow the road of revolution to the end and devote themselves to the country and the people. By intensifying education aimed at convincing young people that our Party’s cause is just and we are sure to emerge victorious, the primary organizations of the youth league should encourage all young people to fight stoutly for the victory of the revolutionary cause of Songun, filled with an unbreakable faith and will. They should organize visits to revolutionary battlesites and historic sites at regular intervals and in a significant way, so as to induce young people to cherish the greatness of the leaders and their imperishable achievements deeply and glorify their life with pure loyalty to the Party and the leaders by emulating the ennobling examples of loyalty of their revolutionary forerunners. The reality in which our revolutionary ranks are formed mainly of a new generation who have a mere book-based knowledge of exploitation and oppression and have never experienced the hardships of war demands that the degree of education in class awareness be raised. By conducting this education in a theoretical and profound way as required by the prevailing situation and the revolution, the primary organizations of the youth league should ensure that young people bitterly hate the imperialists and other class enemies and reliably defend the gains of the revolution won at the cost of blood with a do-or-die determination to fight the enemy to the last. 10 Intensifying education in socialist morality is an urgent demand for further consolidating the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks and making a revolutionary and sound way of life prevail throughout society. Some young people are failing to observe proper decorum in their speech and behaviour and public morality, spoiling the sound public atmosphere and order. These phenomena are a result of the failure of the youth league to conduct education in morality properly. By regarding education in morality as one of its major tasks and pushing ahead with it persistently, the primary organizations of the youth league should see to it that young people respect their revolutionary forerunners, teachers and seniors and voluntarily observe a code of morals. Ideological education should be conducted in various forms, by various methods and in an effective way. It is important to run the educational system established in the youth league, including study sessions for following the example of General Kim Jong Il and lecture meetings, regularly and effectively. Study sessions and various other educational meetings should be arranged frequently at youth school, the base for the education of young people, to make sure it is always lively. Ideological education should be conducted in an original way and in keeping with the sentiments of the advancing times so that it can touch the hearts of young people and guide them along the right path. The primary organizations of the youth league should do away with the practice of filling up numbers in ideological education work or sticking to old formalities and set patterns, which fail to keep pace with the mental qualities of the young people of our times, and steadily improve the form and method of ideological education. The primary organizations of the youth league should adopt decisive measures to ensure that young people take an active part in their organizational activities. They should afford young people a correct understanding of the 11 preciousness of their organizations in order to get them to love and respect the youth league organizations and make conscious efforts to place themselves under organizational education and supervision. They should ensure that all young people are well acquainted with the rules and norms of life in the youth league and live and work in line with them, and carry out the decisions and assignments of their organizations without fail and on time. They should also make sure that their members hold effective meetings to review their life so that they can be tempered in a revolutionary way in the furnace of organizational life. In guiding the organizational life of their members they should not leave it to their spontaneous effort alone, but tighten organizational discipline. Some youth league members are living apart from their respective organizations. This is because these organizations are failing to establish strict organizational discipline. The primary organizations of the youth league should make increasingly exacting demands on their members and tighten organizational discipline, thereby ensuring that they all take part in organizational life. They should provide guidance over the organizational life of their members in close combination with the implementation of their major revolutionary assignments so that working young people can overfulfil their technical innovation assignments and their tasks under the national economic plan, and students can improve their academic performance by studying hard. Primary organizations should proactively conduct the young vanguard model primary committee movement, young vanguard model primary unit movement and young vanguard model class movement, the validity and vitality of which are being demonstrated in practice. Primary officials of the youth league should enhance their sense of responsibility and role. 12 They should be the engines that lead the way in supporting the Party’s Songun-based revolutionary leadership and guide young people to advance straight ahead, following the Party. They should conduct all work as befitting young people with unabated, vigorous energy and mettle. They should plan their work in an innovative manner, conduct it conspicuously and, once they have started it, finish it at a single stretch. They should lead their members by setting practical examples. Practical examples are the most powerful motivation. They should tackle difficult and labour-consuming work ahead of others, influence their members in practice, not in words, and arouse them to struggle and achieve feats. They should be a good example for the members to emulate in all aspects of work and life. They should treasure and love their members like their own brothers and sisters, and join minds and unite in one body in their work and life. They should know the mental agony of their members before anybody else, take care of them in every aspect of their work and life and serve as a foundation for their growth and development. They should grieve over the mistakes of their members as if they were their own and train all young people to be a fine young vanguard by admonishing them even ten times or a hundred times, if once is insufficient. They should always receive them politely and with a bright look, discover the best way of overcoming difficulties in the latter’s strength and wisdom and build up primary organizations into a harmonious collective, sharing joy and sorrow with them. Primary officials should have high political and practical qualifications. They should be fully equipped with the great KimilsungismKimjongilism and wholly conversant with our Party’s ideas and policies on the youth movement, making them an article of their faith. They should not only be proficient in the practical work of the youth league and at a high level in their political and theoretical 13 qualifications and knowledge of modern science and technology, but also be well versed in the situation and their knowledge of many other fields. They should be versatile mass workers who know how to mix with the members unceremoniously and move them by singing and dancing well, playing musical instruments skilfully and making stirring speeches. The youth league committees at all levels should guide primary organizations in a responsible manner and render them positive assistance. At present some committees, preoccupied with arranging ceremonious events and economic campaigns, are not directing much effort to the work with their primary organizations; some officials confine themselves to their offices and spend time doing their work over the telephone or on paper, or urge the primary organizations to submit something or the other. When they neglect the work with the primary organizations, the latter will grow weak and fail to play their role properly. This will result in the youth league overall becoming inefficient. The youth league committees at all levels should get rid of the outdated patterns and armchair style of work in their work with the primary organizations and take decisive steps to intensify their guidance and assistance of the organizations. It is of particular importance to enhance the role of the city and county youth league committees which are its lowest-level units of guidance and deal mainly with the primary organizations. The officials of youth league committees at all levels should make it a rule to go down on a regular basis to the primary organizations and help them. They should frequently visit the primary organizations to learn in detail about the state of affairs there and help them solve any problems. In this way they can encourage the primary officials and help them in a substantial way. It is important to strengthen the ranks of primary officials of 14 the youth league in terms of quality. They should be built up with young men and women who are loyal to the Party, sound both mentally and morally, and exemplary in their organizational life and the implementation of their revolutionary tasks. It is also necessary to work effectively to improve their qualifications. Party guidance over the work of the youth league should be strengthened. Our Party regards the work of the youth league as no less important than Party work. Giving prominence to young people is our Party’s consistent policy and eternal strategic line. Party organizations should pay close attention to the work with youth league organizations as part of their Party work. They should acquaint themselves with the work of the youth league organizations on a regular basis, correct deviations in their work and solve problems in a responsible manner. They should encourage independence and creativity in the primary organizations of the youth league. They should promptly inform them of the Party’s policies in each period so that their officials can draw up their work plans and carry them out in a proactive manner as intended by the Party. They should be bold and assign major tasks to the primary organizations of the youth league and inspire them to carry them out by relying entirely on their own efforts. And they should actively support the creative opinions of the young people and help them translate them into reality. They should also provide the primary organizations with adequate conditions for their independent activities. They should give prominence to the primary officials of the youth league so that they can work with a high sense of honour and pride, and meet them frequently to educate them in a revolutionary way and train them in practical work. They should admit to the Party the excellent officials who are exemplary in youth league work and bring them up as Party officials. 15 As we have a large contingent of successors who are faithful to the Party’s ideas and will and steadfast in following the Party, firmly united around it, we have nothing to be afraid of and nothing we cannot do, and we are certain to achieve final victory. I firmly believe that all our young people will fully demonstrate their heroic mettle as the young vanguard on the historic onward march for accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Songun under the

24.10.2014,Kim Jong-un,"We are marking the 20th anniversary of the great Comrade Kim Jong Il’s on-site guidance at the Mausoleum of King Tangun. President Kim Il Sung had proposed renovating the mausoleum and paid close attention to the project. General Kim Jong Il considered the project as an important undertaking in carrying out his lifetime instructions, and gave energetic guidance to it. On October 29, 1994, while looking round the excellently renovated mausoleum, he said that, as a national treasure to be handed down to posterity, it should be laid out and preserved well, that historical sites and relics should be unearthed in larger numbers to enrich the storehouse of the nation’s cultural heritage, and that they should be inherited and developed properly. Through the solemn renovation of the Mausoleum of King Tangun, carried out thanks to the President’s and the General’s ennobling love for the nation and their wise leadership, it has been clearly verified that Koreans are a homogenous nation who have lived on the same territory carrying the same bloodline since the dawn of human civilization with Tangun as their founding father, and a sacred place of the nation has been established for the patriotic education of all the compatriots. This constitutes a great, auspicious event for our nation and a brilliant victory of the Juche-oriented policy on conserving our national heritage. The great President Kim Il Sung and General Kim Jong Il, recognizing the importance of conserving our national heritage, devoted their efforts to this end throughout the whole course of leading the revolution, thus exalting the brilliance of the time-honoured history and splendid culture of our nation. With his gifted wisdom and Juche-based insight, the President put to rights the historical issues which had been distorted and 1 complicated by the actions of the national chauvinists and great-power worshippers, verifying that our country was one of the cradles of human civilization and clarifying the history of our nation which has continued since the days of Tangun’s Korea in accordance with the law-governed course of historical development. He advanced the policy of inheriting and developing our national heritage from a Juche-based stand, and ensured that many cultural relics which had been buried in history were unearthed and verified, and that historical sites destroyed by foreign aggressors were restored to their original state; he thus saw to it that the cultural heritage created by our ancestors was passed down to the people, as well as to the coming generations, as the assets of the nation. True to the President’s intention, General Kim Jong Il correctly evaluated and clarified the key problems in putting to rights the history of our country, adding lustre to the righteous history of the nation and ensuring that the cultural heritage associated with the wisdom and talents of our ancestors shed their brilliance as priceless wealth linking the history and bloodline of the nation down through the generations. Busy as he was with his Songun-based leadership, he visited historical sites and scenic spots, leading the work of transforming the conservation of our national heritage into an undertaking of instilling in the people the excellence of our nation. He also saw to it that the excellent national traditions handed down through the generations were preserved, so as to make our nation’s unique spirit and sentiments pervade the whole country. He proposed building a folk park, a grand open-air history museum, in Pyongyang to exhibit the culture and customs our people have created from the primitive ages to the modern era. He then channelled great efforts and concern into its construction so as to hand down to posterity the time-honoured history and brilliant culture of our nation. 2 President Kim Il Sung and General Kim Jong Il were true fathers of the nation, peerless patriots and great saints in that, by applying the immortal Juche idea, they not only glorified the modern history of our nation but clarified the 5 000-year history of the Korean nation accurately and demonstrated the nation’s excellence to the whole world. It is the firm will of our Party, by carrying forward their ennobling intentions, to develop our country with its time-honoured history and brilliant culture into a world-class country with an advanced civilization, into an ever-prospering, powerful country. National heritage conservation is a patriotic undertaking for defending the history and traditions of the nation and adding brilliance to them by inheriting and developing the precious spiritual and material wealth created by the ancestors. We should maintain the President’s and the General’s ideas and theory of conserving our national heritage as our guiding principles, and apply them in a thoroughgoing way. Establishing a Juche orientation and remaining faithful to the principle of historical truth and scientific accuracy are fundamental principles we should consistently adhere to in conserving and inheriting the cultural heritage of the nation. We should resolve all the problems arising in conserving our national heritage in keeping with our people’s aspirations, demands, national customs, feelings and sentiments and discover, restore, preserve and maintain the cultural heritage of the nation in a scientific and technological way, based on historical facts. We should properly preserve and maintain historical sites and relics in their original state. A valuable legacy created by our ancestors through their struggle and creative activities, historical sites and relics are an asset of the nation that should be handed down from one 3 generation to the next. When we preserve and maintain them properly, we can instil greater national pride and dignity into the people and inherit and develop the time-honoured history, brilliant culture and excellent traditions of our nation. The longer the history of a nation is, the more brilliantly it shines, and the better historical sites and relics are preserved in their original state, the more valuable they become. Historical sites and relics should be preserved and maintained in their original state so that they can retain the characteristics of the society and historical period with which they are associated. We should properly preserve and maintain the historical sites and relics in Pyongyang and Kaesong, both historical capitals, while paying close attention to preserving and maintaining the historical sites and relics of national value in other parts of the country. We should first restore those associated with the leadership exploits of the President and the General and rebuild, repair and maintain historical sites and relics on a regular basis in accordance with a yearly plan. We should unearth larger numbers of valuable historical sites and relics, thus enriching the storehouse of the nation’s cultural heritage. We should fiercely combat the nihilistic tendency of negating the excellence of our nation and any practices of failing to preserve and maintain historical sites and relics properly and damaging them. We should work actively to sustain the excellent national traditions of our people. These national traditions reflect how time-honoured and excellent our nation is, and its ennobling mental world and unique lifestyle. We should value the precious creations and good manners and customs that are permeated with the wisdom and talents of our nation and have been handed down from one generation to the next, and inherit and develop them in line with the demands of the times. 4 In order to give full scope to the Korean-nation-first spirit, our Party has ensured that our national culture, arts and customs are actively encouraged, folk festivals are celebrated and folk parks and folk streets have been built. In the future, too, we should develop traditional music, dance and fine arts of a strong national character, promote national sports including Taekwon-Do and ssirum (Korean wrestling–Tr.) and encourage people to play such folk games as yut and top-spinning. We should promote our traditional dishes and costumes, sustain the excellence of our language and manners and further develop Koryo medicine and traditional architecture. We should properly conserve and maintain scenic spots and natural monuments. Since olden times our country has been called a 3 000-ri land of golden tapestry with beautiful mountains and clear rivers. A land of golden tapestry means a land that is as beautiful as an embroidery on silk cloth. Our country has many famous mountains and scenic spots including Mts. Paektu, Kumgang and Myohyang, and Chongsokjong, which are envied by the world, and it also has many natural monuments which should be conserved through a national effort and handed down through the generations. Scenic spots were pleasure resorts for the rich and influential in the exploiting society, but they are pleasure grounds and cultural resorts for the people in our society where the people are its masters. We should treasure every tree, every blade of grass and every rock which adds beauty to scenic spots and actively protect the birds and wild animals in these areas. We should take good care of mountaineering paths and facilities in scenic spots and discover more scenic spots, so that people have more to enjoy. It is important in conserving and maintaining scenic spots to preserve them in their original state without damaging the 5 ecological environment. Comprehensive measures should be taken to prevent scenic spots from being damaged or polluted owing to forest fires, the random felling of trees, the development of underground resources, pests, sewage and industrial waste. We should lay out history museums and other bases for history education well, in conformity with the people’s cultural and aesthetic requirements and the trend of the times, and step up education through them. History and folklore museums, folk parks and folk streets are important educational bases for implanting national pride and patriotism in the working people, youth and students. Since history museums and folk streets, once laid out well, will become precious assets of the nation, nationwide attention should be directed to building such educational bases without sparing investment. The history museums, folk parks and folk streets in the capital city and provinces should be renovated as a way of preserving the national identity. The second-stage project of building up the Pyongyang Folk Park as befits a base of patriotic education should be completed at an early date, and those provinces which have not yet built folk streets should construct them, in line with their local features. In the future, the Korean Central History Museum should be laid out on the world standard so that it will serve as a model history museum and history education base. History museums should be built in the provinces to retain the characteristics unique to each locality. It is important to improve the display in museums. Displays of historical relics in the museums should be arranged to ensure scientific accuracy, chronological sequence, vividness and three-dimensional effect so that they help visitors easily understand history. Larger numbers of historical relics should be displayed in the museums so as to enrich the content of the exhibits and leave no historical period uncovered. 6 Proper educational work should be conducted by means of the cultural heritage of the nation and the history education bases. Providing effective education through them will enable the people, including the young people and students, to be well versed in the history, culture and beautiful manners and customs of our nation, cherish their national pride and patriotism and preserve the national identity. Visits to and tours of history museums, folk parks, historical sites and scenic spots should be widely organized. Visits to the nation’s cultural relics are currently not being arranged effectively. When our people go to Mt. Myohyang, they look round the International Friendship Exhibition House and go mountaineering; it would be even better for them to visit the history museum and historical sites on the mountaineering route, but they walk past them. This shows their indifference to history. Every scenic spot and historical site of national importance in our country bears the footprints and leadership exploits of the peerlessly great persons of Mt. Paektu. If people from the provinces come to visit Pyongyang they should be encouraged to look round the Korean Central History Museum, Pyongyang Folk Park, Moran Hill and other historical relics, as well as many other places in the city. And visitors to Mts. Kumgang, Kuwol and Chilbo should be encouraged to look round the historical sites there. Then they will have a better understanding of the leadership exploits of the President and the General, and at the same time get a vivid idea of history and feel even greater national pride. The working people, youth and students should be taught to know about our natural monuments, prides of the nation. The work of conserving the nation’s heritage should be conducted as a campaign embracing the whole country and all the people. Every member of the nation should pour his or her patriotic 7 devotion into this work. Several officials regard it as a matter of lesser importance and put it aside. In some cities and counties valuable historical sites and relics are either being lost or damaged owing to lack of attention to their conservation. Even such practices as damaging the landscape and ecological environment at scenic spots are evident. It is heart-breaking that our precious national heritage was destroyed or plundered during the vicious colonial rule of Japanese imperialism and three-year war unleashed by the US imperialists, and it is all the more intolerable from the viewpoint of our national self-respect that the remaining ones are in a poor state of conservation and maintenance. The neglect of the conservation and maintenance of the cultural heritage of the nation can lead to the loss of its history and traditions. Provincial, city and county people’s committees should entrust institutions, enterprises, cooperative farms and schools with caring for historical sites, scenic spots and natural monuments so as to conserve and maintain the national heritage in an all-people drive, and conduct the work intensively during the general mobilization period for land administration. Education, science, art, literature, publication and media organs should study the national classics, translate and publish them, bring out large numbers of books on historical knowledge, and introduce historical sites and relics and traditional customs in various forms and by various methods. By doing so, we can ensure that working people, youth and students always treasure our historical sites and relics, conserve them well and staunchly continue the spirit of the nation. The Cabinet, the relevant ministries and national agencies should pay due concern to the construction and maintenance of historical sites, museums and scenic spots, and provide the necessary equipment, materials and funds in a responsible manner. A reasonable amount of the revenue from visits to historical sites and scenic spots should be earmarked for the 8 national heritage conservation sector, so that it can independently meet the costs of regular maintenance. Proper laws and regulations pertaining to the maintenance of historical sites, relics, scenic spots and natural monuments should be formulated, and supervisory and control institutions such as the people’s security organs should exercise strict legal controls over any violations of them. It is important to put the conservation of our national heritage on a scientific footing in keeping with the requirements of the developing reality. The era of the knowledge economy requires the scientification of all sectors. If the work of the national heritage conservation sector is not put on a scientific footing, no great successes can be expected of it. This sector, in collaboration with scientific research institutions, should adopt new scientific and technological achievements for preserving and maintaining historical sites and relics, and ensure that paints, reagents and other materials for their preservation can be produced domestically. It is necessary to develop a database of historical sites and relics, scenic spots, natural monuments and our intangible cultural heritage and promote the exchange of relevant information. The Korea National Heritage Preservation Agency should be staffed with experts and their role enhanced so that the agency can function as a scientific research centre and advisory body for conserving the national heritage. It is essential to bring about a radical improvement in the role of the National Authority for the Protection of Cultural Heritage. This is a central organ that takes responsibility for and provides unified guidance over the conservation of the country’s national heritage. Only when the responsibility and role of this organ are enhanced will it be possible to ensure the unified guidance over 9 the conservation of the national heritage and realize the Party’s intentions in this sector. It is essential to enhance the authority of this organ and set up a well-regulated system of guidance over the conservation of the country’s national heritage. In collaboration with scientific research and educational institutions, the organ should unearth and collect larger quantities of tangible, intangible and natural heritage, and work efficiently to deliberate on, register, and evaluate them, while giving unified guidance over the work of conserving the intangible heritage in the capital city and provinces. It should also encourage the non-permanent committees for the conservation of the national heritage in the capital city and provinces to enhance their functions and role. It is important to publicize and commend the compatriots at home and abroad who donate valuable historical relics out of patriotism. The National Authority for the Protection of Cultural Heritage should promote exchanges with international organizations and other countries. It should send delegations of researchers to other countries to help them widen their horizons, arrange joint research and academic seminars with historians and people in the cultural heritage field in other countries, and invite foreign delegations to tour the historical sites and scenic spots in our country. The Koguryo tombs with murals and other historical sites in Kaesong have been inscribed on the world heritage list; continued efforts should be made to have the excellent tangible, intangible and natural heritage of our country inscribed on this list. This will help make our country’s time-honoured history and brilliant culture and our Party’s policy on the conservation of our national heritage known abroad. All the people in the north, in the south and abroad, as compatriots of the same blood, are descendants of Tangun. They 10 should have a common understanding of the issues relating to their national history from the standpoint of attaching importance to the nation, and encourage academic exchanges relating to their national cultural heritage, thus rendering a contribution to adding brilliance to the history of Tangun’s Korea. Party guidance over the work of the national heritage conservation sector should be intensified. Party organizations should equip the officials and working people in this sector firmly with the Party’s policy on the conservation of our national heritage and encourage them to implement it to the letter. Party organizations should encourage them to work hard with a pure conscience, with sincerity and with a high sense of responsibility, cherishing in their hearts the immortal achievements performed for this sector by the peerlessly great persons of Mt. Paektu, and through Kim Jong Il’s patriotism. Among the officials and working people in this sector there are many patriots and unassuming, meritorious people who remain faithful to their jobs in remote mountainous villages, come rain or shine, and whether recognized or not. Party organizations should pay close concern to their work and lives, fairly assessing their successes and exploits and giving prominence to them, and promptly solving any problems. Party organizations at all levels should fill the ranks of officials in this sector with able people. They should post to this sector those who are loyal to the Party and have expertise and a high sense of responsibility, and take prompt measures to make good the shortage of researchers, lecturers, technicians and skilled workers. The relevant departments of the Party Central Committee should approach the conservation of our national heritage as an important undertaking for adding lustre to the achievements President Kim Il Sung and General Kim Jong Il made for the 11 nation’s history, and provide effective policy-oriented guidance to this sector. All officials should strive to implement the Party’s policy on the conservation of our national heritage thoroughly so as to defend the immortal achievements made by the President and the General and add brilliance to the history and traditions of our nation.",mark anniversary jong site guidance mausoleum king tangun sung have propose renovate mausoleum pay close attention project general jong

27.10.2014,Kim Jong-un,"Today I climbed Mt Paektu. On reaching its summit, I admired the majestic view of the mountain itself and its imposing appearance and fortitude in the howling blizzards. Mt Paektu is our ancestral mountain, the sacred mountain of the revolution, which is associated with the soul of our nation and representative of the spirit and stamina of Songun Korea. It is the birthplace of the Juche revolution, the symbol of its victory and the eternal beacon guiding it. It is a marvellous mountain which presents kaleidoscopic shifts. The Great Paektu Mountains starts on Mt Paektu, from which all other mountains on this land extend out. So the roar of this mountain echoes throughout the country. This mountain is the source of dignity for the Korean nation, of pride for our people. The great General Kim Jong Il said that all Korean revolutionaries should learn about Mt Paektu and cherish the revolutionary spirit of Paektu so that the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered on Paektu could be carried down through the generations. Bearing his precious instructions in mind, I climbed Mt Paektu for the first time over 20 years ago. Today I climbed it again in order to have a deeper understanding of how the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the fundamental source of the great mental strength of Kim Il Sung’s nation and Kim Jong Il’s Korea, was created and ensure that the whole country brims over with the revolutionary spirit and fortitude of Paektu. Looking down on the mountains and rivers of the country from Janggun Peak, I was filled with deep emotion, since the sights evoked the majestic images of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il who led the Korean revolution to brilliant victory, braving the storms of history with the soul and 1 spirit of Paektu. Standing on the summit of Mt Paektu, I have hardened my resolve and will to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche that was pioneered on Paektu. Mt Paektu is a witness to history. It embodies the immortal revolutionary history and exploits of our great leaders, their indomitable spirit and fortitude and their ennobling traits. It is the mountain of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. It is the sacred place of the Juche revolution where Comrade Kim Il Sung organized and waged the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. For more than 20 years after he started the Korean revolution he crossed the rugged mountains of Paektu and fought bloody battles, leading the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle to victory and thus achieving the historic cause of national liberation. The primeval forests and crags of Mt Paektu all bear the noble imprint of Comrade Kim Il Sung. General Kim Jong Il’s birthplace is in the Paektusan Secret Camp on the mountain. As the birthplace of our revolution it assures its lineage; as the birthplace of Korea it is dear to the hearts of our people. It has enabled our army and people to travel a road resplendent with victory, enjoying the blessing of having great leaders and generals for one generation after another. The General was born on Mt Paektu during the arduous anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle; having experienced severe trials in his childhood, he grew up into a great revolutionary who embodied the spirit and temperament of Mt Paektu. He regarded it as his lifelong mission to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered on Paektu down through the generations, and he devoted his all to the victory of the revolution and to the country and people. In the 1970s Comrade Kim Il Sung entrusted him with the overall affairs of the Party and the People’s Army. As the General took direct responsibility for these affairs, a new 2 revolutionary turn was brought about in the work of the Party and the army; the Party and the revolutionary ranks were further strengthened and a great golden age of socialist construction was ushered in. The 1990s was a decade of trying ordeals, during which our people suffered the greatest national loss. They also had to undergo the Arduous March and forced march owing to a series of natural calamities and the enemy’s pernicious isolate-and-stifle schemes against our Republic. In this grim period when the Party and the revolution were facing severe difficulties, the General, shouldering the responsibility for the destiny of his country and nation by dint of his energetic Songun-based revolutionary leadership, wisely led the struggle to bring the Arduous March and forced march to a successful conclusion. Thanks to his sagacious leadership our army and people overcame manifold ordeals and difficulties, achieving one victory after another in the confrontations with the enemy; they built a powerful defence industry, laid solid foundations for economic development and demonstrated the dignity of Songun Korea to the whole world. In the future, too, our army and people should regard his birthplace in the Paektusan Secret Camp as their spiritual mainstay, and strive hard to add eternal glory to his undying revolutionary exploits, build a powerful country and achieve the final victory of the revolutionary cause of Songun. Today, in climbing Mt Paektu, we experienced the severity of its blizzards. The blizzards of Paektu, the severe snowstorms of the mountain, are symbolic of the revolutionary fortitude of Paektu. In this season, because of the biting cold and strong wind, those visiting the revolutionary battle sites do not climb the mountain, but we did, in order to have personal experience of the blizzards of Paektu. Only when one climbs Mt Paektu in the midst of a blinding snowstorm to experience the blizzards of 3 Paektu at first hand can one appreciate the real “feel” and attraction of the mountain and harden one’s determination to carry out the Korean revolution. Revolutionaries should have a “feel” of the blizzards of Paektu. For revolutionaries, the blizzards of Paektu are a warm wind which sharpens the edge of their revolutionary faith and assures them that they can achieve miracles and victory, whereas for renegades of the revolution and traitors, they are a biting blast which deals them a crushing blow. Those who have appreciated the “feel” of the blizzards of Paektu become revolutionaries, and those who have not, renegades. In retrospect, those who were unwilling to climb Mt Paektu and gave in for fear of the blizzards of Paektu, degenerated into renegades and traitors. When renegades and traitors appeared and challenged it in the past grim days, our Party punished them without mercy by dint of the blizzards of Paektu. We should cherish the blizzards of Paektu which sharpen the edge of our revolutionary faith and inspire us with firm confidence in final victory, and follow the road of revolution to the end. Our army and people should always live and work in the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu. This spirit is, in essence, an unyielding attacking spirit of braving obstacles and difficulties and a staunch fighting spirit of rising up again no matter how often one may fall and fighting to the last. It is an ennobling spirit which our army and people should cherish for ever in their hearts and the most precious spiritual wealth that must not be bartered for anything in the world, however valuable. When we live in this spirit, we will have nothing to fear and nothing will be beyond our strength. To be fully equipped with this spirit is all the more important 4 for our young people of the new generation who have emerged as the main force of the revolution. Only when these people, who have not experienced the severe trials of the revolution, live in the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu, can they fully understand the greatness of the Party and the leader and how precious is their country, and creditably perform their mission as successors to the revolutionary cause of Juche, the revolutionary cause of Songun. The country is still in a tense situation. The US imperialists and their vassal forces are making a last-ditch attempt to stamp out the people-centred socialism of our style and haul down the red flag of revolution which our army and people are holding high. They are resorting to more vicious schemes in trying to obliterate our country politically, isolate it economically and attack it militarily. On the other hand, they are clinging to the anti-DPRK “human rights” campaign and the despicable psychological smear campaign, in a foolish attempt to tarnish the prestige of our dignified country and shake the revolutionary faith of our army and people who fully trust and follow their Party alone. In the future the situation may become more serious, compelling us to undergo even greater difficulties than we did during the Arduous March and forced march. However, whatever ordeals and difficulties we may encounter on the road of revolution we will advance along the road of independence, Songun and socialism, as we have chosen, and achieve without fail the final victory of our revolution. In order to win final victory in the showdown with the enemy we should ensure that the service personnel and people have a deep understanding of Mt Paektu and that in life and work they cherish the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu, until it courses through their blood. 5 It is important to make proper arrangements for visits to the revolutionary battle sites in the Mt Paektu area. These revolutionary battle sites are bases for education in the revolutionary traditions associated with the sacred history of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle led by Comrade Kim Il Sung. Visits to these revolutionary battle sites are very important in educating the service personnel and people in the revolutionary spirit of Paektu and inspiring them to live and work in keeping with the requirements of this spirit. Making proper arrangements for such visits will help them to broaden their knowledge of Comrade Kim Il Sung’s immortal revolutionary history and achievements and the indomitable revolutionary spirit of their forerunners who fought a bloody war against Japanese imperialism under his command. It will also be effective in giving them a correct understanding of the historical roots of our revolution and encouraging them to wage a staunch struggle to continue the revolutionary cause of Juche that was pioneered on Paektu. In March this year I had a visit organized to the revolutionary battle sites in the Mt Paektu area for the commanding officers of the combined units of the People’s Army and went there myself to meet and encourage them. The Party’s intention in organizing this visit was to make these officers experience the blizzards of Paektu and feel to their marrow how our Party’s revolutionary traditions were established. The officers must have keenly felt the severity of the blizzards, marching through the virgin snow and bivouacking in the open. This was followed by visits by senior Party officials and officials of working people’s organizations from across the country. Several sectors and units are currently arranging visits to the revolutionary battle sites in the Mt Paektu area, with the aim of acquiring the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the 6 blizzards of Paektu. In the future, such visits should be organized more often so that all officials, service personnel and working people are equipped with the great leaders’ revolutionary ideas and undying exploits and our Party’s brilliant revolutionary traditions. The visits should be organized on an extensive scale in combination with regular national tours and ordinary ones. We should give full play to the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu, in order to raise the fierce flames of a leap forward in the struggle for defending socialism and on all fronts for building a powerful country. To wage a bold offensive sailing with the blizzards of Paektu is a tradition of struggle for our army and people, and it constitutes an ideological and spiritual characteristic of theirs. When we advance dynamically with our hearts burning with the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu, we can achieve miracles and transformations in all sectors, thus hastening final victory in building a powerful country. Next year is a significant year, in which we will mark the 70th anniversaries of the liberation of the country and the founding of the Workers’ Party of Korea. The grand celebration of these anniversaries will establish a historic milestone in adding eternal lustre to the exploits the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il performed in liberating and building the country and founding and developing the Party, as well as in bringing forward under the leadership of the Party the final victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche, the revolutionary cause of Songun, pioneered on Paektu. All service personnel and people should, by carrying forward the spirit of defending the leader to the death, the spirit which pervaded the forests of Paektu, safeguard the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun and the Party Central Committee with their very lives, 7 share one purpose with our Party and throw in their lot with it for ever. The officers and men of the People’s Army, bearing in mind the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu, should establish an atmosphere of intensive training as befits the army of Mt Paektu, and make full combat preparations so that they can play a major role in the struggle for defending socialism and in the great war for achieving national reunification. Officials, Party members and all the other working people should, by emulating the indomitable revolutionary spirit, the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, of the anti-Japanese fighters, overcome the difficulties and trials by their own efforts and work world-startling miracles. Sportspeople should win every competition by applying guerrilla-style offensive tactics embodying the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu. Holding high the slogan “Let us produce, study and live like the anti-Japanese guerrillas!” all sectors and all units should learn from the work attitude and lifestyle of the anti-Japanese guerrillas, and live and work in a revolutionary and militant manner so that the whole society overflows with animation and ardour. An aggressive ideological offensive should be launched to imbue the whole society with the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu. Ideological education is an important undertaking that should be carried on constantly in the whole process of building a powerful socialist country, just as today when we are in acute confrontation with the enemy. Even in the future when everything prospers and our people are well-off, we should intensify their ideological education. We should educate and awaken the people ceaselessly and assiduously. 8 Party organizations and working people’s organizations should conduct effective ideological education of Party members, service personnel, and youth and students in various forms and by various methods, including education through visits to revolutionary battle sites and other historic sites. Artistic and literary works on the theme of Mt Paektu should be produced in large numbers. A good song should be created about the mountain. This song should reflect the unshakeable determination of Party members, service personnel, and youth and students to have a “feel” of the blizzards of Paektu, firmly arm themselves with the revolutionary spirit of Paektu and carry the revolutionary cause of Juche through to the end, down through the generations, following the Party. The Mt Paektu area should be laid out well. As an eternal treasure of our revolution associated with the great leaders’ revolutionary history and imperishable exploits, it should be laid out in the best possible fashion as befits the sacred place of the revolution, and firmly defended. General Kim Jong Il’s birthplace is in Samjiyon County. We should not merely shout a slogan to the effect that we must carry forward the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered on Paektu through the generations. We should lay out Samjiyon County well to add eternal lustre to the General’s revolutionary career and exploits and ensure that cheering for the Workers’ Party and for socialism starts resounding in the first village under Mt Paektu, the sacred place of our revolution. This is also necessary in ensuring that foreign tourists visit the Mt Paektu area. It is imperative to press on with all the ongoing projects, including those for the renovation of the Samjiyon Schoolchildren’s Palace, the Samjiyon County Hall of Culture, the Hostel for Visitors to the Samjiyon Revolutionary Battle Site 9 and the Sports Village in the Mt Paektu area, and ensure the high quality of the projects. The hostels for visitors to this area should be refurbished as befits lodgings for the visitors to revolutionary battle sites, in line with the requirements of the new century. As the Party is determined to lay out Samjiyon County in the best possible fashion, high quality should be guaranteed in all construction projects. To this end, the problems of electricity and transport need to be resolved. Nationwide efforts should be directed to the construction of the Paektusan Songun Youth Power Station so as to complete it as soon as possible. The youth league has taken charge of this construction project; after finishing it, the electricity should be supplied to Samjiyon County. If the supply of electricity to the county is inadequate, the public buildings and other structures that are now being renovated cannot be managed and operated on a regular basis, much less the underfloor heating in the local houses. The construction of the Paektusan Songun Youth Power Station should be accelerated on the strength of army-people joint operations. The key bottlenecks in the construction of the power station are the production and transport of cement and the manufacturing of power generators for its units 2 and 3. The Cabinet, State Planning Commission, ministries, national agencies and Party organizations at all levels should be fully conscious of the importance of this project and concentrate their efforts on it. At the same time as stepping up the efforts to build the power station, the laying of power-transmission lines from it to Samjiyon County should be pushed forward. A broad-gauge railway leading to the county should be built. This is essential in developing it into a modern locality. 10 Next year, in which we will mark the 70th anniversaries of national liberation and the founding of the Party, the whole country, Ryanggang Province in particular, should be stirred up. We should ensure that all service personnel and people live and work in the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu, so as to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche, the revolutionary cause of Songun, pioneered on Paektu, true to the instructions the great leaders gave in their lifetime.",today climb paektu reach summit admire majestic view mountain itself impose

01.01.2015,Kim Jong-un,"Dear comrades! Having seen out 2014, a year in which we clearly demonstrated the spirit and might of the great DPRK that advances by leaps and bounds with confidence in victory, we are seeing in the hope-filled new year 2015. Reflecting the boundless loyalty of all the service personnel and people, I would like to pay the highest tribute and offer New Year greetings to President Kim Il Sung (Kim Il-so’ng) and General Kim Jong Il (Kim Cho’ng-il), the eternal leaders of our people and the sun of Chuch’e. I extend New Year greetings to the service personnel and people who are striving with devotion for the dignity and prosperity of the country with revolutionary faith and patriotic enthusiasm, and I wish the families throughout the country would overflow with warm affection and our lovely children would have a brighter future. My New Year greetings go also to the compatriots in the south and abroad who are fighting for national concord and reunification and to the progressive peoples of the world and other foreign friends who aspire after independence and peace. Last year was a year of brilliant triumph in which the foundations for hastening final victory on all fronts of building a thriving nation were consolidated firmly and the invincible might of the DPRK was demonstrated under the leadership of the Party. Last year the harmonious whole of the Party and the masses of the people was solidified and the purity and might of the revolutionary ranks strengthened. The ardent yearning of our service personnel and people for the President and the General became intenser as the days went by and they fully manifested their passionate loyalty and pure sense of moral obligation to translate into reality the great leaders’ plans and wishes. Our Party’s politics of love for the people and younger generation and its policy of attaching importance to science and education were embodied in reality and thereby the people’s trust in the Party deepened and our single-hearted unity hardened. Amid the drive for carrying on education in revolutionary traditions through the study tour of the revolutionary battle sites in the Mt. Paektu area, the entire army and the whole society came to pulsate with the spirit and mettle of Paektu and bubble with the conviction and will to carry through the sacred revolutionary cause of Chuch’e. Last year the fighting efficiency of the People’s Army was increased remarkably and national defence capability was built up. As the army conducted political and ideological work in a positive manner and stoked the flames of training under combat conditions, all its officers and men and units of services and arms became strong in ideas and faith and prepared as an invincible army capable of discharging operational and combat missions proficiently in any circumstances and conditions. Iron military discipline was established in the entire army and unprecedented successes were made in the improvement of soldiers’ living. The defence industry sector developed and completed various means of military strike of our style to make a tangible contribution to the qualitative growth of the revolutionary armed forces. Last year we made great progress in the building of a socialist economic giant and civilized nation by the joint operation of the army and people. Even in the difficult situation and adverse conditions last year, an upswing was brought about in production in different sectors including agriculture, fishery and chemical and coal-mining industries, opening up bright prospects for the building of an economic giant and improvement of the people’s living standards. The construction sector kindled the fierce flames for creating the Korean speed to build many monumental structures that serve as standards and models of Chuch’e-oriented architecture including the Wisong Scientists Dwelling District, apartment houses for lecturers of Kim Ch’aek University of Technology, Yo’np’ung Scientists Holiday Camp and October 8 Factory, thereby actually demonstrating the looks of the DPRK that is realizing its beautiful ideals. The service personnel who engaged in the building of a thriving country achieved breakthroughs in production, construction and modernization and created excellent model units in the spirit of devotedly implementing the Party’s policies and the spirit of match-for-a-hundred combatants. Our sportspeople undauntedly fought by our own style of tactics in the 17th Asian Games and world championships to exalt the honour of the country and greatly encourage the service personnel and people who were out in the struggle to defend socialism. All the victories and priceless successes we achieved last year are a brilliant result of the Party’s wise leadership and of the burning patriotic loyalty and self-sacrificing struggle of all the service personnel and people rallied firmly behind the Party. I extend heartfelt thanks to all the service personnel and people who made a contribution to glorifying last year as a year of proud feats and changes by waging an unyielding struggle with a steadfast faith in the revolutionary cause of Juche and the military-first (So’ngun) revolutionary cause. Comrades! The new year 2015 will be a year of great significance, in which we will mark the 70th anniversaries of national liberation and founding of the Workers’ Party of Korea. Greeting this significant year, our people are looking back with great pride and dignity upon the glorious 70-year history of our Party and homeland which have achieved shining victories under the wise leadership of the President and the General; they are full of confidence and optimism with a determination to follow the Party and achieve final victory in the Chuch’e revolution pioneered on Mt. Paektu. This year we should display the revolutionary spirit and mettle of Paektu to scathingly thwart the challenges and manoeuvres by hostile forces and score a signal success in the struggle to defend socialism and on all fronts of building a thriving nation. By doing so, we should celebrate the 70th anniversaries of national liberation and founding of the Party as revolutionary, auspicious events. Upholding the slogan “Let us all turn out in the general offensive to hasten final victory in the revolutionary spirit of Paektu!” all the service personnel and people should charge dynamically towards the venue of grand October celebrations. Bearing in mind the soul and mettle of Paektu, we should become honourable victors in the general offensive to exalt the dignity of our socialist country and promote its prosperity on the strength of ideology, arms and science and technology. This year we will further consolidate our country’s invincible might as a socialist political and ideological power. We should invariably hold up the President and the General forever as the sun of Chuch’e, staunchly championing and adding eternal brilliance to their immortal revolutionary exploits. In this year of the 70th anniversary of the Party, which organizes and guides all victories of our people, we should set up a new milestone in improving its leadership ability and fighting efficiency. We should steadily intensify the work of establishing the Party’s monolithic leadership system to make the whole Party share ideology with the Party Central Committee, breathe the same breath as it and keep pace with it. All Party organizations should maintain implementing the Party’s lines and policies as the major line of Party work, and carry every one of them to completion unconditionally. We should ensure that the people-first principle runs through the whole of Party work as appropriate for its nature as a motherly party to make the climate of respecting, loving and depending on them pervade it and Party work focus on improving their living standards. All the organizations and officials of the Party should eliminate abuses of power and bureaucratism, and take warm care of the people and lead them properly to make sure that the latter trust and rely on it as they would do their mothers and throw in their lot with it. We should hold fast to ideology as the Party’s powerful weapon and make an ideological offensive to consolidate the ideological position of our revolution rock-solid. We should promote education in the greatness of the leaders, Kim Jong Il’s (Kim Cho’ng-il) patriotism, faith, anti-imperialist and class consciousness and morality to train all Party members, service personnel and other working people into staunch fighters of the military-first (So’ngun) revolution and make them raise the fierce flames of patriotic loyalty, creation and innovation at all posts in national defence and for building a thriving nation. This year we should further demonstrate our country’s might as a military power by bringing about a fresh turn in building revolutionary armed forces and enhancing its defence capability. The People’s Army should thoroughly establish the Party’s monolithic command system across the entire army and vigorously conduct the movement of winning the titles of O Chung Hup-led 7th Regiment and Guards Unit. Thus it should implement to the letter the Party’s four-point strategic line and three major tasks for increasing military strength. It should effect a turnaround in improving the quality of training by eliminating formalism and stereotyped patterns in combat and political training and updating its contents and methods. It should maintain full combat readiness so that it can repulse any provocation by the enemy in one stroke. By bringing about a radical turn in its supply service, it should provide soldiers with better living conditions and make all its battalions and companies elite combat ranks and their dear villages and homes that adjoin the yard of the office of the Party Central Committee. In the future, too, it should be a pioneer and example in the struggle to implement the Party’s ideas and safeguard its policies in pursuance of its plan for building a thriving nation. In line with the requirements of the prevailing situation, the officers and men of the Korean People’s Internal Security Forces should sharpen the sword for defending the leader, system and people, and members of the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and the Young Red Guards should conduct combat and political training in a real-war atmosphere, thereby beefing up their combat efficiency and getting fully prepared for an all-people resistance so that they can defend their own provinces, counties and villages by themselves. By carrying out the Party’s line of promoting the two fronts simultaneously, the defense industry sector should step up the efforts to make the munitions production Chuch’e-oriented, modern and scientific and proactively develop and perfect powerful cutting-edge military hardware of our own style. This year we should give definite precedence to science and technology and effect an upswing in building a socialist economic giant and civilized nation. It is a determination and will of our Party to rapidly develop all sectors and build a people’s paradise by dint of science and technology. The front of science should forcefully rush ahead in the vanguard of a thriving socialist country building, thereby foiling the enemy’s pernicious moves for sanctions and encouraging all the economic sectors to make rapid headway on the strength of the high-running spirit of independence and of science and technology. The scientific research sector should wage a brisk drive for going beyond the cutting edge to produce many valuable findings conducive to developing the economy, increasing defence capability and improving the people’s living standards. Regarding science and technology as their lifeline, all sectors and all units should step up modernization and introduction of information technology in our style, raise the scientific and technological level of officials and working people and vigorously carry on all undertakings by relying on science and technology. We should make maximum use of the existing foundations and all potentials of the self-supporting economy, so as to bring about a turn in improving the people’s living standards and building an economic giant. In this significant year we should bring about an upturn in improving the people’s living standards. We should resolve the food problem of the people and improve their dietary life on a higher level with agricultural production, animal husbandry and fishing as the main thrusts. The agricultural sector should overcome unfavourable natural conditions and overfulfil the cereals production plan by actively introducing scientific farming methods including water-saving farming, supplying sufficient amounts of farming materials and organizing and guiding production in conformity with actual conditions. We should put the production at stockbreeding and fish-farming bases, greenhouses and mushroom production bases built across the country on a regular footing and ensure that the people benefit from them. True to the Party’s plan, we should dynamically speed up the building of the stockbreeding bases in the Sep’o area and make steady preparations for livestock production and their operation. By emulating the working spirit of the People’s Army which made a new history of “sea of gold,” the fishing sector should drastically bolster up the fishing industry and land a huge haul, thus supplying a large amount of fish to enrich the people’s diet. Fully aware of the responsibility and mission it assumes for the people, the light industry sector should work out a strategy for fending for itself and put production at central and local light-industry factories on normal track, so as to supply our people, including students and children, with larger amounts and various kinds of quality consumer goods, school things and children’s food. We should direct great efforts to relieving the shortage of electricity, a major source of power of the national economy, and strive to shore up its vanguard sectors and key industries. We should increase coal and electricity production in the mettle displayed in bringing about innovations in the coal-mining industry and thermal power stations last year and meet the immediate demand for electricity by waging a campaign to economize on electricity to the maximum, while taking realistic measures to resolve the electricity problem in a prospective way. We should develop metal, chemical and other basic industries and brace rail transport by relying on our own technology and resources and thus ensure that all other economic sectors smoothly progress full of vigour. We should foster external economic relations in a multilateral way and accelerate the projects for economic development zones including the Wo’nsan-Mt. Ku’mgang international tourist zone. We should raise a stronger wind of creating the Korean speed in the construction sector so as to build power stations, factories, educational and cultural establishments and dwelling houses as befit the monumental edifices in the era of the Workers’ Party. By completing with credit the major construction projects, including the multi-tier power stations on the Ch’o’ngch’o’n River, Kosan Fruit Farm and Mirae Scientists Street, we should splendidly adorn the venue of grand October celebrations. The whole Party, the entire army and all the people should, as they carried out rehabilitation after the war, turn out in the campaign to restore the mountains of the country so as to turn them into “mountains of gold” thickly wooded with trees. All the sectors should invariably push ahead with the work of afforesting and landscaping the whole country and turning it into orchard, and build Pyongyang, provinces, cities, county seats, workplaces and villages in a more cultured way and maintain and manage them on a regular basis. All the economic sectors and units should make positive efforts to increase production, improve the quality of goods and enhance their competitive edge by working out proper strategies for business operation and enterprise management and tapping all possible reserves and potentialities. All the factories and enterprises should wage a dynamic struggle to get rid of the proclivity to import and ensure the domestic production of raw and other materials and equipment, while sprucing themselves up by taking their cue from the model units put forward by the Party. The Cabinet and other state organs for economic guidance should make proactive efforts to establish the economic management method of our style as demanded by the reality so that all the economic organs and enterprises can conduct their business activities creatively on their own initiative. Party organizations at all levels should throw their full weight behind the work of improving economic management in order to make sure that it is done as intended by the Party. A vigorous spur should be given to the building of a civilized socialist nation. We should bring about a radical improvement in education in the new century by arousing state and social interest in the role of officials in this sector and educational work, thereby making fresh progress in making all the people well versed in science and technology and developing ours into a talented nation. The whole country should bubble with enthusiasm for sports and our sportspeople should fly higher the flag of the Republic at international games to open up bright prospects for building a sporting power. The sector of art and literature should do away with stagnation and produce larger numbers of contemporary masterpieces which inspire the masses to further efforts, and the public health sector should improve the hygienic and anti-epidemic work and preventive and curative medical care and boost pharmaceutical production. We should make sure that national sentiments and noble and beautiful lifestyle prevail across society, and press on with national heritage conservation as a patriotic undertaking involving the whole country and all the people. In order to successfully carry out the enormous tasks for this year all the officials, Party members, service personnel and other working people should live and work in the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu. The spirit is, in essence, an unyielding offensive spirit of braving obstacles and difficulties and a staunch fighting spirit of rising up no matter how often one may fall and fighting it out. The hearts of all our service personnel and people should beat with the confidence in victory and indomitable spirit cherished by the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners who fought death-defyingly for their country and people and won victory against all odds. All the officials, Party members and other working people should enter the venue of grand October celebrations proudly with gifts they have prepared by dint of the revolutionary spirit of Paektu and through creative struggle. The whole country should overflow with the spirit of patriotic devotion with which to hold dear and add brilliance to our own things. Holding dear and adding brilliance to our own things is just the Korean-nation-first spirit and the genuine patriotism that exalts the dignity of our country, our motherland, and hastens its prosperity. We should value and add lustre to all the assets the preceding generations of the revolution created on this land at the cost of their blood and sweat under the guidance of the Party and the leaders, and create and develop everything in our own way with a high sense of national pride and by relying on our strength, technology and resources. Officials, leading participants in the revolution, should be the standard-bearers and vanguard fighters in the ongoing general offensive. They should faithfully serve the country and people for their prosperity and well-being with a noble outlook on patriotism and firm preparedness for devoted service and, shouldering heavy burdens by themselves, make redoubled efforts in the van of the masses. With a full understanding of the Party’s ideas and intentions, officials should go deep among the masses and rouse them to carry through its lines and policies unconditionally at the cost of their lives. They should be fully accountable to the Party and the state for the work in their sectors and units, eliminate defeatism, self-preservation and expediency and do everything in an innovative and scientific way. Seventy years have passed since our nation was divided by outside forces. In those decades the world has made a tremendous advance and the times have undergone dramatic changes, but our nation has not yet achieved reunification, suffering the pain of division. It is a deplorable fact known to everyone and it is lamentable to everyone. No longer can we bear and tolerate the tragedy of national division that has continued century after century. Last year we put forward crucial proposals for improved inter-Korean relations and national reunification and made sincere efforts for their implementation. Our efforts, however, could not bear due fruit owing to the obstructive moves by the anti-reunification forces within and without; instead the north-south relations have been on a headlong rush to aggravation. However complicated the situation may be and whatever obstacles and difficulties may stand in our way, we should unfailingly achieve national reunification, a lifetime wish of the President and the General and the greatest desire of the nation, and build a dignified and prosperous reunified country on this land. “Let the whole nation join efforts to open up a broad avenue to independent reunification in this year of the 70th anniversary of national liberation!”-this is the slogan of struggle the entire Korean nation should hold up. We should remove the danger of war, ease the tension and create a peaceful environment on the Korean peninsula. The large-scale war games ceaselessly held every year in south Korea are the root cause of the escalating tension on the peninsula and the danger of nuclear war facing our nation. It is needless to say that there can be neither trustworthy dialogue nor improved inter-Korean relations in such a gruesome atmosphere in which war drills are staged against the dialogue partner. To cling to nuclear war drills against the fellow countrymen in collusion with aggressive outside forces is an extremely dangerous act of inviting calamity. We will resolutely react against and mete out punishment to any acts of provocation and war moves that infringe upon the sovereignty and dignity of our country. The south Korean authorities should discontinue all war moves including the reckless military exercises they conduct with foreign forces and choose to ease the tension on the Korean peninsula and create a peaceful environment. The United States, the very one that divided our nation into two and has imposed the suffering of national division upon it for 70 years, should desist from pursuing the anachronistic policy hostile towards the DPRK and reckless acts of aggression and boldly make a policy switch. The north and the south should refrain from seeking confrontation of systems while absolutizing their own ideologies and systems but achieve great national unity true to the principle of By Our Nation Itself to satisfactorily resolve the reunification issue in conformity with the common interests of the nation. If they try to force their ideologies and systems upon each other, they will never settle the national reunification issue in a peaceful way, only bringing confrontation and war. Though the people-centred socialist system of our own style is the most advantageous, we do not force it on south Korea and have never done so. The south Korean authorities should neither seek “unification of systems” that incites distrust and conflict between the north and the south nor insult the other side’s system and make impure solicitation to do harm to their fellow countrymen, travelling here and there. The north and the south, as they had already agreed, should resolve the national reunification issue in the common interests of the nation transcending the differences in ideology and system. They should briskly hold dialogue, negotiations and exchanges and make contact to relink the severed ties and blood vessels of the nation and bring about a great turn in inter-Korean relations. It is the unanimous desire of the fellow countrymen for both sides to stop fighting and pave a new way for reunification by concerted efforts. They should no longer waste time and energy over pointless arguments and trifling matters but write a new chapter in the history of inter-Korean relations. Nothing is impossible if our nation shares one purpose and joins efforts. On the road for reunification the north and the south had got such charter and great programme for reunification as the July 4 Joint Statement, the historic June 15 Joint Declaration and the October 4 Declaration, thus demonstrating to the whole world the nation’s determination and mettle to reunify the country. We think that it is possible to resume the suspended high-level contacts and hold sectoral talks if the south Korean authorities are sincere in their stand towards improving inter-Korean relations through dialogue. And there is no reason why we should not hold a summit meeting if the atmosphere and environment for it are created. In the future, too, we will make every effort to substantially promote dialogue and negotiations. The entire Korean nation should turn out together in the nationwide movement for the country’s reunification so as to glorify this year as a landmark in opening up a broad avenue to independent reunification. Last year, in the international arena, hostilities and bloodshed persisted in several countries and regions due to the imperialists’ outrageous arbitrariness and undisguised infringement upon their sovereignty, which posed a serious threat to global peace and security. Especially, owing to the United States’ extremely hostile policy aimed at isolating and suffocating our Republic, the bulwark of socialism and fortress of independence and justice, the vicious cycle of tension never ceased and the danger of war grew further on the Korean peninsula. The United States and its vassal forces are resorting to the despicable “human rights” racket as they were foiled in their attempt to destroy our self-defensive nuclear deterrent and stifle our Republic by force. The present situation, in which high-handedness based on strength is rampant and justice and truth are trampled ruthlessly in the international arena, eloquently demonstrates that we were just in our efforts to firmly consolidate our self-reliant defence capability with the nuclear deterrent as its backbone and safeguard our national sovereignty, the lifeblood of the country, under the unfurled military-first (So’ngun) banner. As long as the enemy persists in its moves to stifle our socialist system, we will consistently adhere to the military-first (So’ngun) politics and the line of promoting the two fronts simultaneously and firmly defend the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation, no matter how the international situation and the structure of relations of our surrounding countries may change. On the basis of the revolutionary principles and independent stand, we will expand and develop foreign relations in a multilateral and positive way, giving top priority to the dignity and interests of the country. Our Party and the government of our Republic will solidify in every respect the bond and solidarity with the world’s progressive peoples who love peace and aspire after independence and justice, and strive to develop good neighbourly relations with all the countries that respect our national sovereignty and are friendly to us. No force in the world can check the advance of our army and people who are rushing forward like the blizzards of Mount Paektu filled with rock-firm revolutionary faith and mettle of invincibility under the leadership of the great Party, and final victory undoubtedly belongs to us. Let us all staunchly strive to glorify this significant year as a year of great victories and revolutionary, auspicious events, rallied more closely behind the Party and singing aloud the march of final victory.

28.01.2015,Kim Jong-un,"The most important task facing us today is to improve the people’s standard of living at an earlier date. Our people have so far waged an intense struggle to build socialism in the difficult condition of confrontation with the enemy; this being the situation, they have never enjoyed a plentiful life to their heart’s content. Whenever I am reminded of my failure to provide a rich life to these laudable people, who, in spite of their difficult living conditions, have firmly trusted and followed only our Party and remained faithful to their pure sense of moral obligation to the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, I cannot get sleep. And whenever I receive a report that, though not so significant, a difficulty the people experienced in their living has been solved or, though not so large in quantity, something has been supplied to them, I feel most delighted. We should provide our people, who have entrusted their all to the Party and stood by it in braving all manner of trials and hardships together with the Party, with the most abundant and happiest life in the world at an earlier date. In order to improve the people’s standard of living, we should, while doing farming well, develop animal husbandry and fishing, and thus resolve their food problem. At the New Year Address for this year I advanced the task of resolving the food problem of the people with farming, animal husbandry and fishing as the major thrust areas. If we keep up with these sectors and develop them actively, we can find a satisfactory solution to the food problem of the people. In order to develop animal husbandry, our Party has put forward the policy of reclaiming the Sepho Tableland and turning it into a large-scale livestock farming base. Reclaiming this area and turning it into a livestock farming base was an earnest instruction of President Kim Il Sung and General Kim Jong Il. In the days of the fierce Fatherland Liberation War, the President, with an eye to the victorious tomorrow of the country, unfolded a far-reaching plan to develop animal husbandry by reclaiming the Sepho Tableland. While leading the socialist construction after the war, he stressed the need to improve the living standards of the farmers in the Sepho area by raising large numbers of domestic animals in the pastures on the tableland, and had a farm specializing in animal husbandry built there. True to his intention the General clarified the ways and means for developing animal husbandry on an extensive scale by reclaiming the tableland. In accordance with the Party’s plan and operational intention to translate the wish of the President and the General into reality, a vigorous struggle is now being waged to build a large-scale, modern livestock farming base in the Sepho area. This is the first time for our country to create pastures covering tens of thousands of hectares and build a large-scale livestock farming base. Though they are inexperienced and many things are in short supply, the builders of the large-scale livestock farming base in the Sepho area are creating miracles and innovations to the wonder and admiration of all by giving full play to the fighting spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. The service personnel of the People’s Army and shock-brigade members, who have gone to the Sepho area in hearty response to the Party’s call, have created tens of thousands of hectares of pastures in a short period, taking up the challenges of Nature, and overfulfilled the last year’s target of grass production. Great successes have also been achieved in the road work and the construction of dwelling houses, animal sheds, public buildings and other structures. Though the successes achieved are great, the future tasks are gigantic. Building on the already-achieved successes, we should attain the set targets as soon as possible by bringing the soaring spirit of the service personnel and shock-brigade members to a new high. The most important task in turning the Sepho area into a large-scale livestock farming base is to improve the soil and create pastures. The soil of the Sepho area, in general, lacks humus and has become acidified, so grasses for grazing animals cannot be produced in large quantities if their seeds are scattered on that soil. The soil should be improved. It can be said that the destiny of livestock farming in the Sepho area is dependent on how the soil is improved. We must not leave the infertile soil of the Sepho Tableland as it is. Many bombs and bullets from the days of the Fatherland Liberation War have been unearthed while reclaiming the tableland; we must not forget that every inch of the land belongs to the country which our forerunners defended at the cost of their blood and even their lives. We should not allow even an inch of the country’s priceless land to lie fallow but turn it into a fertile land where the people’s happiness blossoms, as it is associated with the lofty, patriotic aim of the President and the General and permeated with the red blood of our forerunners. A saying goes that a good farmer does not complain of bad land; when we break sweat and work with sincerity to cultivate the land, it will become fertile no matter how it might be. The builders of the livestock base in the Sepho area should enrich the soil of the Sepho Tableland with the warm sincerity of bringing flowers into bloom even on a rock and the patriotic zeal of holding dear every handful of earth and every blade of grass and devoting themselves heart and soul to looking after them. On the basis of a detailed analysis of the soil in the Sepho area, they should apply sufficient amounts of slaked lime, coal ashes and hukposan and other organic fertilizers to radically increase the soil’s content of nutrients. Sustained efforts should be made to improve the fertility of the pastures even after the completion of the livestock base project in the Sepho area. The soil of the tableland is mostly impervious to water, making it highly susceptible to damage from heavy rains, so due concern should be paid to ensuring good drainage. As the Sepho area is subject to strong winds all the year round, the builders should create windbreaks according to a far-reaching plan. They should plant seeds of fine grass species in the area and manure and maintain the pastures in a scientific and technological way. On the pastures they should plant orchard grass, alfalfa, clover and other good species of grasses for grazing animals. Sepho, Phyonggang and Ichon counties should fend for themselves in producing the grass seeds to be scattered on the pastures in their charge, and a nationwide campaign should be waged to collect and send superior seeds to them. As the Sepho area varies greatly in altitude and climate and its topography is complex, we should distribute pasture grasses and crops appropriately on the principle of planting the right ones on the right soil, and perfect the methods of manuring and cultivating them in conformity with the geographical features to boost their output. We should look after the pastures well as we do crop fields, applying fertilizers and agro-chemicals and sprinkling water on them. I sent the officials concerned a book titled Cultivation of Pastures and Ranches for reference; we should adopt the good experiences other countries have gained in cultivating pastures to meet our specific conditions. We should speed up construction of dwelling houses, animal sheds, public buildings and other architectural structures and road work, and finish off with them on a high qualitative level. We must build a livestock research institute and a livestock processing base in the Sepho area without fail. All structures there should be fit for their uses and in keeping with the scientific and technological requirements; they should also blend well with the natural landscape and be impeccable even by future standards. Effective guidance and supervision should be given over the building work of the structures so as to ensure their best possible quality as befit those of the model livestock farming base in the 21st century. Fuel, materials, manpower and equipment needed for the livestock farming base project should be supplied on a priority basis. The Cabinet and relevant units should provide cement, steel and other construction materials and equipment as planned, and organize their transportation properly to make the project proceed according to the schedule. We should make good preparations for operating the livestock farming base in the Sepho area. Now construction of the livestock farming base is in full swing in this area, but preparations for its operation and speedy production, such as procurement of animals, are not going smoothly. We should send good breeds of animals to the Sepho area and post sufficient numbers of stockbreeding technicians and breeders beforehand, so that upon completion of the project the livestock farming base can pay off soon. Breeding Station No. 621 of the Korean People’s Army and the Ungok Area Combined Livestock Farm should produce boer goats and many other good breeds of grazing animals and send them to the livestock farming base in the Sepho area. We should also bring in animals from foreign countries to raise them in this area. The work of reclaiming the Sepho Tableland and building a livestock farming base there should be done as a campaign involving the whole Party and the entire country. I have ordered the senior officers of the People’s Army to take the lead in reclaiming the tableland. The Party Central Committee, the Cabinet, commissions, ministries and central agencies should all pay concern and channel their efforts to the project. While stepping up construction of the livestock farming base in the Sepho area, drastic measures should be taken to shore up the country’s livestock farming as a whole. The Party’s important objective in giving priority to the above construction project is to provide momentum for effecting a fresh turnaround in developing the country’s livestock farming as a whole. We should normalize production at the modern livestock farming bases built under the Party’s leadership. In those trying years of the Arduous March and forced march, the General ensured that many modern livestock farming bases including chicken, pig and cattle farms were built across the country for improving the people’s dietary life. The capacity of these bases built under his energetic guidance is enormous. If production is put on a normal footing at these bases, it will be possible to produce large quantities of meat and eggs and supply them to the people. However, several of them are not functioning properly because officials failed to take measures necessary for their normal operation after they were built. To normalize production at the existing livestock farming bases and thereby ensure that the people perceive the General’s love and benevolence through actual life is a duty and moral obligation devolving upon our officials who are his soldiers and disciples. Putting their production on a normal footing is not merely an economic and technical matter but an important aspect of political work for safeguarding and adding brilliance to his leadership exploits. It is necessary to work out objectives and scientific strategy for business operation and enterprise management so as to normalize production on a high level at the livestock farming bases associated with his leadership exploits and scrupulously organize the economic work to rapidly increase meat and egg production. During on-site guidance at the Taedonggang Combined Fruit Farm the other day, I referred to the need for fruit farms to wage a production emulation drive among themselves. In the stockbreeding sector units associated with the General’s leadership exploits should also raise a strong wind of socialist emulation drive and bring about an upswing in livestock production. A dynamic mass-based drive for increasing livestock production should be waged. Collective livestock farming at cooperative farms and private livestock farming at rural households should be developed. These types of livestock farming hold no small share in the country’s livestock production. To develop these types of livestock farming is a major way for increasing livestock production without large investment from the state. All cooperative farms should build up their stockbreeding workteams and animal-fattening subworkteams and ensure profitability of their operation. It is important to give them assignments for the production of the young and meat and make them fulfil these assignments without fail. Private livestock farming at rural households should be encouraged. Every house teeming with domestic animals adds to the socialist rural scenery. Rural households should be encouraged to raise large numbers of pigs, goats, rabbits, chicken and other kinds of domestic animals so as to augment their income and enrich their lives. Livestock farming should be undertaken at all units. Now many units, including the Songjin Steel Complex and Namhung Youth Chemical Complex, are in the limelight for their effective livestock farming and supply services for their employees. With the view that supply services are precisely political work and part of the struggle to defend socialism, all organs and enterprises should promote livestock farming in conformity with their actual conditions, thereby raising the enthusiasm for labour on the part of their employees and dynamically inspiring them to carry out their revolutionary tasks. In order to develop livestock farming, it is necessary to solve the problems of animal breeds and their feed, improve the methods of raising them and take thoroughgoing veterinary and anti-epizootic measures. Superior breeds, sufficient amounts of feed, scientific rearing methods and thoroughgoing veterinary and anti-epizootic measures can be called four major factors for developing livestock farming. Solving the problem of breeds is a prerequisite for developing livestock farming. Breeds are to livestock farming what seeds are to crop cultivation. Only when we raise domestic animals of superior breeds, can we produce large quantities of meat and eggs with less amounts of feed. For livestock farming to be done on a mass basis, the problem of breeds should be solved first. Many animals of superior breeds should be obtained through proper breeding. Efforts should be focused on developing breeds that grow quickly on less amounts of feed, breed fast and are highly resistant to diseases. It is particularly important to develop the breeds that consume small amounts of cereals and give benefits in a short span of time. We should breed large numbers of animals of superior breeds by establishing a Juche orientation and proactively applying the achievements of cell and genetic engineering and other branches of modern science and technology. Animal breeding should not be done only by the central research institute, but also by local livestock farming bases and individual persons so as to develop animal breeds that suit their specific conditions. Meanwhile, brisk scientific and technological exchanges should be conducted with foreign countries so as to bring in domestic animals of superior breeds and raise them after going through the stage of performance testing. State inspection of breeds and their use should be intensified. A system should be established of registering and using breeds, either domestically bred or brought in from abroad, after going through inspection by the state. It is important to build up pedigree and breeding farms and establish a thoroughgoing system of breed production and supply. Nationwide efforts should be directed to modernizing pedigree and breeding farms and providing them with necessary amounts of feed on a preferential basis. Methods of producing first-filial generation and breeding stock should be improved based on the latest achievements of science and technology, and scrupulous arrangements be made for their supply. Along with this, a system of preserving the first-filial generation should be set up to ensure that superior domestic animals neither degenerate nor become extinct. Our Korean breed domestic animals, including pigs and chickens that produce tasty meat of unique flavour, should be well preserved and propagated. The first-filial generation of the famous Korean breed oxen and Phungsan dogs should also be preserved well and propagated widely. To solve the animal feed problem is a decisive guarantee for developing livestock farming. In developing livestock farming feed is no less important than breeds. No matter what excellent breeds may be obtained, it is impossible to develop livestock farming unless feed is amply provided. Livestock farming, which had been prospering for a certain period in the past, got stagnated because of the failure to solve the feed problem. Implementing the Party’s policy of “grass for meat” is the way of solving the animal feed problem. “Grass for meat” is an aphorism the President had presented as early as the 1950s. This aphorism clarifies a scientific way of solving the animal feed problem in conformity with the actual conditions of our country and the basic orientation of the development of our country’s livestock farming. We should develop livestock farming using grasses instead of cereals as instructed by the President. To this end, it is important to create pastures in various parts of the country. Pastures, both artificial and natural, should be created in conformity with the topographical features of relevant units, so as to cultivate grasses of high nutritive value and increase their unit-area yields. As the arable land is limited and there are many mountains in our country, it is necessary to widely introduce agroforestry to solve the animal feed problem and increase grain production. Livestock farming units should bring new land under plough in order to plant nutritive grasses and build pumpkin pergolas, while cultivating arrowroots in the mountainous areas and aquatic plants in the areas with rivers and lakes. By doing so, they can solve the feed problem on their own. We should solve the problem of cereals needed for livestock farming through good crop farming. The General, whenever opportunity offered, instructed that both meat production and grain yield can be increased at the same time only by thoroughly establishing a food production cycle of stockbreeding and crop farming. The food production cycle should be introduced widely in line with the Party’s policy, thereby boosting both grain and livestock outputs. We should also solve the problem of feed rich in protein. As products of animal husbandry contain much protein in them, meat and eggs cannot be produced sufficiently unless protein feed is provided. Soybean farming should be encouraged to increase defatted beancake production, and at the same time proteinrich insects and various other protein feed resources should be enlisted to the maximum. It is necessary to meet the demand for feed additives. At present not a few stockbreeding units are using feed additives purchased from foreign countries; in this way, we cannot run stockbreeding bases properly. In our country there are factories that produce feed additives, but they, too, rely on basic materials imported from abroad. We should study and perfect the method of producing feed additives with locally-available materials and thus supply the feed additives needed for running stockbreeding bases. Production of animal feed should be industrialized based on advanced science and technology. Assorted feed factories should be renovated and supplied with sufficient amounts of raw materials, so that they can turn out large quantities of perfect compound feed with various nutritive elements. We should take necessary measures to make feed-processing machines and send them to stockbreeding units. Animal raising should be conducted in a scientific and rational way. Livestock farming is also a science. As effective crop cultivation is ensured by scientific farming, livestock farming should also be based on science. Only then can we increase livestock production and guarantee cost-effectiveness. Animals should be raised in conformity with their physiological features. The stockbreeding sector should fix proper feed units according to the purpose of raising animals and the stages of their growth, provide them with full conditions for growth and raise them in line with their living behaviours. It should also fix proper periods of their gestation and slaughtering. Animals should be raised in conformity with the geographical features. As the principle of the right crop on the right soil should be abided by in crop cultivation, right breeds of animals should be raised in right areas. Livestock farming should be done based on a detailed consideration of the natural and geological features and various conditions of the given areas. Livestock research institutes should improve their role in establishing scientific raising methods. They should intensify research into putting all the processes of livestock production on a scientific basis and introducing rational raising methods. In particular, they should direct their efforts to the research into increasing the animals’ weight with no or less grain feed and perfecting the methods of raising animals in the rainy and winter seasons. We should build up the research bases, provide scientists and technicians with good working conditions and set up a well-regulated scientific and technological guidance system. In order to raise animals in a scientific way, the officials and working people in the stockbreeding sector should possess specialized scientific knowledge and technical skills. The central scientific research organ and stockbreeding units should be connected via a computer network so that the officials and working people can keep abreast of the world trend of stockbreeding development and introduce scientific raising methods. We should also arrange exchanges of experiences, demonstration lectures and the like frequently among the stockbreeding units to give wide publicity to the advanced raising methods and good experiences. Veterinary and anti-epizootic work is the life of animal husbandry. The President and the General said the stockbreeding sector should direct its first and foremost concern to intensifying anti-epizootic work. By doing so, it can decrease death rate of animals and put livestock production on a safe basis. In this sector anti-epizootic work immediately means production. All the livestock farming units should furnish themselves with proper anti-epizootic facilities and regularly make medical checkup of animals and disinfect their sheds. The livestock farming bases should strictly restrict the entrance of outsiders and raise animals in a hygienic and cultured way so as to eliminate the root cause of outbreak of various diseases including epidemics and parasitosis. As various livestock diseases are spread around the world doing serious harm to animal husbandry, anti-epizootic inspection should be intensified at border crossings so as to ward off such diseases from other countries. Especially such highly contagious diseases as foot-and-mouth disease and avian flu should be kept away in a thoroughgoing way. If an animal disease breaks out or if there is a possibility of such danger looming, the relevant area should be sealed off in time and thoroughgoing anti-epizootic measures taken. Nothing should be compromised with regard to issues related with the veterinary and anti-epizootic work. Firm material and technical foundations should be laid for the veterinary and anti-epizootic sector. The organs in this sector should build themselves up and furnish themselves with sufficient amounts of modern diagnostic facilities, testing appliances and reagents. Measures should be taken by the state to produce and supply disinfectants, medicines and instruments needed for treating animal diseases. Livestock farming units should make veterinary medicines for themselves with herbs. Party organizations should enhance their role in carrying out the Party’s policy on improving the people’s standard of living by reenergizing the stockbreeding sector. They should hold fast to the Party’s policy on developing livestock farming and carry it out with all consistency. Keeping in mind our Party’s plan and intention to provide the people with affluent living conditions by developing livestock farming, they should set scientific and reasonable plans for reinvigorating livestock farming as suited to the specific features of their own units, and press on with the work until they see its vitality in reality. They should never belittle livestock farming and give it up halfway, hesitating or vacillating in the face of hardships and difficulties, as some of them did in the past. Party organizations at all levels, those in the stockbreeding sector in particular, should conduct a proactive political offensive to rouse officials and working people to carry out the Party’s line on animal husbandry. They should implant in their hearts the ennobling love for the people cherished by the General all his life, so that they will all turn out enthusiastically to carry out the Party’s policy. They should give wide publicity to the units and working people that do livestock farming with all consistency and enjoy benefits from it, and generalize their experiences.",important task face today

26.02.2015,Kim Jong-un,"In a few days’ time we will be marking Tree-Planting Day, a significant day when the great President Kim Il Sung kindled the flames of the movement for planting trees. Busy as he was with leading the building of a new country after national liberation, the great leader climbed Moran Hill on March 2, 1946; seeing the mountains and rivers of the country, damaged during Japanese imperialist colonial rule, he unfolded a far-reaching plan to turn all the mountains into thickly-wooded resorts for the people by having trees planted in large numbers. Forests are precious resources of the country and a wealth to be handed down to posterity. Our country has been called a land of golden tapestry thanks to its mountains thick with forests and fields covered with beautiful flowers. However, as people have been felling trees at random since the days of the Arduous March on the plea of obtaining cereals and firewood and, worse still, as no proper measures have been taken to prevent forest fires, the precious forest resources of the country have been devastated. As the mountains are sparsely wooded, even mildly heavy rain in the rainy season causes flooding and landslides, and the rivers dry up in the dry season; this greatly hinders economic construction and the effort to improve people’s standard of living. Despite this, our officials have confined themselves to reconstructing roads and buildings damaged by flooding, while failing to take measures to eliminate the cause of the flood damage by planting large numbers of trees on the mountains. At present, the forests of our country can be said to be at a crossroads–whether perishing for ever or being restored. We can no longer ignore the issue of the forests. As long as the forests are left as they are, no one can claim that he is a master of the country, nor can he speak about patriotism. 1 Grieving for the country’s declining forests, the great General Kim Jong Il drew up a plan for covering the whole country with trees and flowers, and devoted great efforts until the last days of his life to translating it into reality. I cannot forget what he used to say when, on the road of Songun-based leadership, he saw mountains with no trees; he said it was the aftermath of the Arduous March, and gave earnest instructions that we should plant large numbers of good tree species on the bare mountains so as to turn the misfortune into a blessing and hand down to the coming generations beautiful mountains thick with forests. We can never hand down to the coming generations bare mountains, piles of earth. It is the unshakable determination and will of our Party to turn all the mountains into thickly-wooded “treasure mountains,” into “gold mountains,” within the coming ten years, true to the intentions of the great President and General. The entire Party, the whole army and all the people should conduct a vigorous forest restoration campaign to cover the mountains of the country thickly with forests. Forest restoration is a challenging and complex undertaking that involves raising saplings, transplanting them and then cultivating them year in, year out in the face of the harsh challenges of nature; it is a gigantic nature transformation project to turn all the mountains of the country into “treasure mountains,” into “gold mountains.” The forest restoration campaign is a war to improve nature. What is important in conducting this campaign is to push ahead simultaneously with the creation and conservation of forests. We should bring about a sweeping revolution in forest creation. Forest creation should not be done by planting a few trees ceremoniously on Tree-Planting Day or transplanting fullygrown trees, as was done in the past. It should be done by raising saplings in large numbers and enlisting all the people in transplanting and cultivating them. 2 For effective forest creation, first of all saplings should be raised and supplied in sufficient numbers. Raising saplings is the first process of forest creation; success in the forest restoration campaign depends on how nurseries provide saplings. Nurseries are to a forest restoration campaign what munitions factories are to a war. Just as one cannot be victorious in battle if he is not provided with ammunition, so we cannot conduct the forest restoration campaign successfully if nurseries fail to grow saplings in sufficient numbers. The Central Nursery and other nurseries should mass-produce various good species of saplings. At a time when the country was in a very difficult situation, the General, with a far-sighted plan, had the Central Nursery built as a modernly-equipped producer of saplings, and bequeathed it to us as part of his legacy. The Central Nursery should raise the level of its science, industrialization and intensity in growing saplings and overfulfil its production plan, thus taking a significant share in the forest restoration campaign. Provincial nurseries should also be renovated. They should have modern equipment, like the Central Nursery. Whatever the amount of investment, we should provide ample conditions for laying out sapling production bases. At provincial nurseries, the greenhouses for raising saplings are currently not in good shape; they should be renovated. Modern greenhouses are essential to putting sapling production on a scientific, industrial and intensive footing. Each province should build a model greenhouse that conforms with the characteristics of growing saplings and their uses, and generalize the experience. The provincial nurseries should be provided with the diverse material and technical conditions necessary for producing saplings in sufficient numbers. Nurseries should obtain the seeds of good species, improve the fertility of the sapling fields, take positive steps to introduce 3 advanced growing methods and take all possible precautions against damage from pests. The officials and employees there, with a full awareness of the important duty they have assumed in the forest restoration campaign, should strive to boost production in the same manner as they would display when making bullets and shells for soldiers on the battlefield. Trees should be planted with care. Otherwise, the precious saplings that have been raised with so much effort will wither, and the restoration of the forests will be delayed. Every year trees are planted on such occasions as the Period of General Mobilization for Land Administration and the Tree-Planting Month in Spring. But the forests of the country show little signs of improvement; this is because the survival rate of the transplanted trees is low as a consequence of their careless planting. It is important to plant many trees, and it is all the more important to plant them with care and increase their survival rate. A lot of people in several sectors will be enlisted in treeplanting, and they should be given proper guidance so that they work according to the technical regulations. It is necessary to inform the officials, service personnel, workers, students and other young people who are enlisted of the specific planting methods, and make exacting demands on them so that they plant trees according to the technical regulations. After planting trees, it is important to manure and cultivate them properly. Saplings require much effort and care if they are to grow into big trees. The technical regulations should be strictly observed in the processes of growing them, such as in watering, manuring and removing the weeds and shrubs. Ailing and useless trees should be weeded out promptly and replaced. A rigid system should be established whereby organs and enterprises take responsibility for the survival of the trees they have planted. 4 It is important in the forest restoration campaign to lay out forests of economic value, protective forests and scenic forests in a rational way. Afforestation should be done on the principles of planting the right trees in the right soil and in the right season and planting ten after felling one. Mixed forests and agroforestry should be actively introduced, and afforestation should be done by combining transplanting and natural regeneration appropriately to meet the actual conditions. We should make great efforts to conserve the country’s forests. We should push forward this undertaking from the standpoint that forest conservation precisely means the protection of the land, the ecological environment and the economy. Just as the public health sector takes prophylactic measures to protect people against diseases, so we should conserve the forests to prevent damage to them. Random felling of trees in the mountains must be prohibited. Some people climb mountains and cut down trees as firewood or timber without permission, as they care nothing about the country’s forests. The unauthorized felling of trees is tantamount to treachery. All the people on this land should treasure and protect every blade of grass and tree in their country. They should be encouraged to take part in forest conservation efforts in a manner befitting masters with a noble sense of civic duty and law observance, so as to eliminate any practice of damaging the forests. Pest control is important in conserving forests. To this end, it is essential to intensify the preventive observation of pests so as to detect their appearance and take prompt measures to stop them spreading. A mass-based pest control drive should be conducted from March to May every year. Pest damage should be prevented by various methods, such as applying biological and chemical pesticides and protecting and increasing the numbers of their natural enemies. 5 Comprehensive measures should be taken to prevent damage from forest fires. Forest fires can reduce to ashes in an instant forest resources created through long, painstaking efforts. The state should establish a system of watching for forest fires, raising the alarm and mobilizing people, make the necessary material and technical preparations for promptly putting out a forest fire once it breaks out, and build fire belts as required by the regulations and maintain them properly. People may climb mountains in spring and autumn to collect medicinal herbs and for various other purposes; they should be taught to observe the set order strictly. In particular, scrupulous measures should be adopted against forest fires during the seasons when they are most likely to break out. In order to conserve forest resources, we should provide sufficient fuel for the people. Positive measures should be taken to solve this problem, including creating forests for firewood wherever it is needed and increasing the production and supply of coal. There are several units which have solved the fuel problem with biogas, fly ash or ultraanthracite. By actively popularizing their experience, we should ensure that all regions solve the fuel problem by their own efforts. Various sectors should take measures to use smaller amounts of timber so as to lower the degree of reliance on the forests. We should direct close attention to developing forest science and technology. We can successfully promote forest creation and conservation when we rely on science and technology. Forest science and technology institutes should study and solve the scientific and technological problems arising in tree breeding and in forest creation and conservation. They should focus on breeding and widely proliferating good tree species that are of economic value and suitable to the climatic and soil conditions in 6 our country. Along with this, they should conduct scientific research for perfecting the methods of planting and tending trees as suited to the geographical features and actual conditions in our country. They should develop methods for planting trees all year round. They should also solve the problems arising in creating forests on a planned basis and conserving and maintaining them. We should take measures to introduce and widely disseminate the global achievements of advanced science and technology related to forest creation and conservation. As there are few good tree species in our country, we should bring in such trees from abroad and widely proliferate them after acclimatizing them. We should grow large numbers of such trees as P. strobes, which the General spoke highly of, and spread them across the country. We should work effectively in disseminating forest science and technology among officials and the working people. As all the people are enlisted in forest creation and conservation, they should understand the methods of planting and tending various species of trees. Centres for disseminating science and technology have been established in various parts of the country; based on these centres, a brisk drive for disseminating forest science and technology should be conducted to keep people abreast of world trends in the development of forest science and technology. In order to develop forest science and technology, we should build up the Academy of Forest Science. Some officials are now neglecting the work of building up this academy, claiming that the effort to develop forest science and technology takes too long to pay off. They should not do so. We should develop the Academy of Forest Science into a world-class academy. And we should also improve the forest science institutes in the provinces. We should tighten supervision and control over forest creation and conservation. 7 Now that a powerful national forest supervision organ has been established in accordance with a measure taken by the Party, it should effectively conduct forest supervision and control in a unified way. We should intensify legal controls over forest creation and conservation. If legal controls are weak, there may be no halt to law violations. The state should tighten legal controls over forest creation and conservation so that negative elements cannot appear. A serious issue should be made of random felling, whatever the unit and person concerned. Units should be properly rewarded or punished according to their efforts with regard to forest creation and conservation. We should build up the ranks of forest rangers and enhance their role and sense of responsibility. As forest restoration is a long-term undertaking that is carried out with an eye to ten years in the future, we should persevere in carrying it through to the end. We cannot achieve success in our effort for forest restoration if we make a one-off effort. Officials should cherish deep in their hearts the General’s aphorism that one should live not merely for today but for tomorrow, and we should persevere with forest creation and conservation by regarding it as our constant task. The plan for forest restoration should not remain a piece of paper bearing figures and charts. We should turn all the mountains into “gold mountains” covered with thick woods and thus demonstrate in practice that Korea does whatever it is determined to do. We should set forest restoration as a major task for the Party, the state and the army and forcefully push ahead with it by enlisting all forces and means. Forest restoration is important political work for implementing the instructions of the President and the General and one of the greatest patriotic undertakings for the development 8 of our country, our nation, and the prosperity of posterity. Because forest restoration is a very important undertaking, the Party has ensured that its Central Committee, the DPRK National Defence Commission and the KPA Supreme Headquarters issued a joint resolution calling on the entire Party, the whole army and all the people to turn out in a dynamic forest restoration campaign, and powerful headquarters for the campaign were formed. The entire Party, the whole army and all the people should be enlisted in the forest restoration campaign. Only when the whole country and all the people are involved can the forest restoration campaign prove fruitful. The entire Party, the whole army and all the people should turn out in the campaign in the same way that they carried out reconstruction after the war. “Let the entire Party, the whole army and all the people be enlisted in a vigorous forest restoration campaign!”– this is the militant slogan our Party puts forward today. The People’s Army should take the lead in the forest restoration campaign. As in all other undertakings, it should play the vanguard role in this campaign. The political commissars of army units at all levels should take direct charge of forest creation and conservation and push ahead with it. In the campaign the army and people should make concerted efforts to display the might of great army-people unity to the full. Mass-based movements should be launched to ensure the campaign’s success. It is our Party’s traditional method of work to propel the revolution and construction by means of mass-based movements. Just as they launched the Chollima Movement after the war, so Party and working people’s organizations should conduct vigorous movements to win the titles of Forest of Socialist 9 Patriotism and Model County in Afforestation. Youth league organizations, in particular, should wage a movement to create Youth Forests and Children’s Union Forests and tend them properly so as to encourage all the youth and students to contribute to covering their home villages and mountains with forests. Information and motivation work should be launched vigorously to rouse the entire Party, the whole army and all the people to take part in the forest restoration campaign. If we inspire all the service personnel and people with patriotism and enlist their spiritual strength through effective information and motivation work, there is nothing in the world we cannot achieve. The biggest reserve in every undertaking is the spiritual strength of the masses. We should conduct an energetic information and motivation offensive to give fullest play to the spiritual strength of officials and the working people. The spirit of Kim Jong Il’s patriotism should be displayed to the full in the forest restoration campaign. In the course of carrying out the campaign, people’s patriotism can be evaluated. It is said that a large number of trees have been planted annually in recent years, but creating forests is not progressing as it should; this shows that our people have not worked heart and soul and instead only paid lip service to their patriotism. Patriotism is the noble spirit of valuing every tree in the country and devoting one’s sweat and sincerity to tending it, and one’s patriotic feeling develops while he plants and tends every single tree. All officials, service personnel, working people and youth and students should remember that forest creation and conservation is one of the greatest patriotic undertakings for the future of the motherland, so that they can turn out in the forest restoration campaign with soaring patriotic enthusiasm. All sectors and all units should conduct frontline-style information and motivation work to ensure that the whole 10 country brims over with revolutionary ardour and vigour, as it did in the days of postwar reconstruction. Party and working people’s organizations should strive intensively and ceaselessly to conduct information and motivation work related to forest restoration. Newspapers, radio and television broadcasts and all other means of disseminating information and motivating people should be enlisted. The forest restoration headquarters should improve their role. Whether or not the forest restoration campaign is carried out successfully in line with the Party’s intention depends largely on their role. They should work out proper long-term, stage-by-stage and annual plans, and make scrupulous arrangements and exercise effective command to carry them out. No deviations should be revealed during the campaign. Officials should stand in the vanguard of the forest restoration campaign. They should not just hang around in their offices, checking statistics, but go out to the pulsating fields like the commanding officers of the People’s Army and lead the masses in the campaign, shouting the order, “Forward after me!” Just as we have achieved one victory after another in the confrontation with the forces hostile to us, including the US imperialists, while not firing a single shot, so we should achieve a brilliant victory without fail in the forest restoration campaign to eliminate the aftermath of the Arduous March and hand down lasting wealth to posterity. I believe that our officials, service personnel, working people and youth and students, who have always been faithful to the Party, will turn out as one in the forest restoration campaign, a noble patriotic cause, in hearty response to the call of the Party Central Committee.",few day mark tree planting significant sung kindle flame movement planting tree busy lead building new liberation

25.05.2015,Kim Jong-un,"I am delighted that Chongryon (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan) is greeting the 60th anniversary of its founding in the stirring period when a dynamic struggle is being waged to celebrate as grand national events the 70th anniversaries of national liberation and the founding of the Workers’ Party of Korea. On the occasion of this anniversary, I extend warm congratulations and compatriotic greetings to the officials of Chongryon including Chairman Ho Jong Man, and to all our other compatriots in Japan. Chongryon is a prestigious organization of overseas citizens of our Republic, which the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il formed and led. The proud road travelled by Chongryon bears the imprints of the wise guidance and painstaking efforts of the great leaders, who strengthened and developed Chongryon into a Juche-based overseas compatriots’ organization that represents the rights and interests of all Koreans resident in Japan. The great Comrade Kim Il Sung was the pioneer of the overseas compatriots’ movement in the era of independence, the founder of Chongryon and the saviour and benevolent father of the Koreans resident in Japan. With insight into the actual situation of the movement of Koreans in Japan, which was vacillating at a crossroads between rise and fall and searching for the correct path, the President saved the movement from its crisis by advancing a wise policy on changing its line, and had Chongryon, the first-ever Juche-based overseas compatriots’ organization, formed. He indicated the road ahead of Chongryon at every stage of the development of the movement of Koreans in Japan, and with great affection led 1 the organization and the Koreans resident in Japan along a road resplendent with glory. The great Comrade Kim Jong Il was an outstanding leader who, true to the President’s great idea, developed Chongryon into a vanguard patriotic movement, into a model of patriotic loyalty to the motherland and into a model overseas compatriots’ movement. He was also the saviour of the destiny of Chongryon and of the Koreans resident in Japan. He built up the ranks of Chongryon officials to be singlehearted in their unity and strong in their ideology and faith, and defended the organization with the might of Songun. Regarding Chongryon as part of the socialist country and the Koreans resident in Japan as his own flesh and blood, he ensured that even in the most difficult days, when the country was undergoing the Arduous March, material and spiritual assistance was rendered unsparingly for the development of national education by Chongryon, of the dignity of the Koreans resident in Japan and of their stable life. Thanks to his trust and warm affection, Chongryon could demonstrate to the world its pride in being a model overseas compatriots’ organization. Indeed, the 60 years of Chongryon is a brilliant history of the idea of the Juche-based overseas compatriots’ movement put forward by the great leaders and their wise guidance, and a history adorned with legendary tales of their ennobling love for the nation and their overseas compatriots. Under the wise guidance of the peerlessly great men of Mt Paektu and enjoying their affection, Chongryon has over the past six decades travelled a glorious road of development, and performed great exploits for the motherland and the nation. Sharing its destiny with the great leaders and the motherland, it has developed invincible ranks that fully demonstrate its might of single-hearted unity. In the crucible of the struggle to establish 2 the ideological and leadership system of Juche, it has become a truly Juche-based, patriotic organization that regards believing in and following only the great leaders and realizing their intentions and wishes as its inherent duty. Today, as a powerful body that has been rallied organizationally and ideologically based on the great Juche idea and that has struck deep root among the broad sections of the masses of the Koreans resident in Japan, it is forcefully promoting the movement of Koreans in Japan. This is a proud, genuine feature of Chongryon. Chongryon is demonstrating its might as an able organization which is invariably carrying forward the baton of patriotic work. In the face of difficult conditions in an alien land, it is bringing up the children of the Korean compatriots as true patriots through its well-knit national education network ranging from primary school to university, and has trained the hard core of the masses of Korean compatriots of the new generation, including the core youth and businesspeople who will add brilliance to the history of the movement of Koreans in Japan and who are resolutely carrying on the lineage of patriotic devotion. This is a pride of Chongryon and a source of its might. Chongryon has rendered an active contribution to the sacred cause of achieving the prosperity of the socialist DPRK and the reunification of the nation. Its officials and our other compatriots in Japan have performed distinguished service for the prosperity of their motherland out of ardent patriotism, breathing the same air and keeping step with the people in their homeland. With confidence in the justness of the policies of our Party and the government of the Republic on national reunification, Chongryon has done its best to implement them and contributed to cementing solidarity with the people of Japan and the rest of the world and raising the international profile of the Republic. Our Party and the government of the Republic feel great pride 3 in having Chongryon, a patriotic overseas compatriots’ organization that is boundlessly faithful to its leaders, the homeland and the nation. Availing myself of this opportunity, I pay tribute to the Chongryon officials of the older generations, including Han Tok Su, and the other patriotic compatriots who dedicated their lives to holding the great leaders in high esteem, organizing Chongryon and strengthening the movement of Koreans in Japan, and extend warm thanks to all the officials of Chongryon and other Korean compatriots in Japan who are devoting all their energies and zeal to accomplishing Chongryon’s patriotic cause without thought of any personal fame or reward. Chongryon and our Korean compatriots in Japan are now faced with the honourable task of adding glory to the immortal exploits of the great leaders and bringing about a new upsurge in the movement of Koreans in Japan by keeping step with the people in the homeland on a general onward march. Chongryon should carry out all its undertakings thoroughly as intended and desired by the great leaders, and usher in a new golden age of the movement of Koreans in Japan, true to the General’s instructions. It should strengthen and develop itself as befits a powerful, Juche-based overseas compatriots’ body that shines with the august names of the peerlessly great men of Mt Paektu. It should pay primary attention to establishing the ideological and leadership system of Juche across its organizations and carry on this work without letup. It should hold the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in high esteem for ever, and staunchly defend and add eternal brilliance to their idea of building up Chongryon and to their undying leadership exploits. It should take their ideology and achievements as an eternal guideline for the movement of 4 Koreans in Japan, and thoroughly implement the instructions they gave to Chongryon and to the compatriots in Japan. It should continue to give priority to consolidating the singlehearted unity of its ranks in every way. All the organizations and officials of Chongryon, regarding this unity as the great foundation of the movement of Koreans in Japan, should rally around the central leadership with one mind and purpose, and accomplish its patriotic cause, which was launched through comradely unity, by dint of comradeship. Its organizations should always remember that the single-hearted unity of the ranks of Chongryon and the warm affection shared by the compatriots are a source of its might and represent a new golden age of the movement of Koreans in Japan, and make every possible effort to establish rock-solid unity among the masses of the compatriots. It is important to conduct more dynamically information and education work aimed at giving full play to the spiritual strength of Chongryon officials and our other compatriots. Chongryon should concentrate its efforts on educating its officials and our other compatriots in the greatness of the great leaders and Kim Jong Il’s patriotism, and make constant efforts to inculcate in them the Korean-nation-first spirit and the history and traditions of the movement of Koreans in Japan. In accordance with the present situation, it should intensify education in faith so that all its officials and other compatriots, including the new generation, will steadily follow the road travelled by the preceding generations, cherishing a firm belief in the invincibility of their socialist motherland and the validity of the patriotic cause of Chongryon. In line with the demands and conditions of the prevailing situation, Chongryon should establish a well-knit information and education system and make strenuous efforts constantly to create 5 new and effective forms and methods of information and motivation work. The mass media, including Joson Sinbo, should increase their appeal by writing and editing articles in a way suited to the characteristics and preparedness of the readers. The Kumgangsan Opera Troupe and the song and dance troupes in local areas should, as befit Juche-based overseas Korean national art groups developed under the guidance of the leaders, conduct brisk artistic activities suited to the emotional and psychological characteristics of the compatriots so as to implant the soul of the Korean nation deeply in them and ignite their patriotic enthusiasm. Chongryon should build its subordinate organizations into powerful, patriotic ones which have taken deep root among the masses of the compatriots. It should strengthen its chapters, branches and other grassroots organizations into reliable buttresses infused with love for the homeland and nation. It should direct its efforts to solidifying its chapters, the regional bases of the movement of Koreans in Japan. It should also inspire its branches, the basic units of the compatriots, so that every place where Koreans live brims over with harmony, unity and love for the country and nation. Chongryon organizations and affiliates at all levels should conduct powerful mass political work among the compatriots to rally them in larger numbers. By doing so, it can consolidate and continuously expand the mass foundations of the movement of Koreans in Japan. Adhering to the mass line in all its work, Chongryon should give top and absolute priority to improving the lives of the compatriots and defending and guaranteeing their interests, and solve all problems by relying on their patriotic enthusiasm and creativity. In order to expand and strengthen its patriotic motive force, Chongryon should channel all its efforts into a campaign to win 6 back the compatriots while promoting it in close combination with various movements to develop national culture, mass-based sports activities, campaigns to defend Koreans’ rights, and service and welfare activities. By doing so, it can develop the campaign to win back the compatriots into a powerful one that is advanced by the efforts of Koreans, its master. It should continue to direct strenuous efforts to championing the democratic national rights and interests of the Koreans resident in Japan and to developing national education, work with the young people of the new generation and work with businesspeople. Defending and guaranteeing the democratic national rights and interests of the Koreans resident in Japan is the basic mission and duty of Chongryon. Chongryon should make positive efforts to safeguard and expand all the rights our compatriots are entitled to as overseas citizens of a sovereign state, such as the rights to be educated, conduct business and travel freely to their motherland, and staunchly resist all discriminatory measures and inhumane acts that infringe upon their rights and interests. National education is something Chongryon should invariably hold fast to as one of its central tasks. It should direct its main efforts to establishing the Juche orientation in its educational work and thus imparting love for the country and national identity, while improving the contents and methods of education as appropriate to the era of the knowledge-based economy, thus giving play to the advantages and vitality of democratic national education. Korea University should steadily raise the level of its education as befits a base for training able personnel for Chongryon, and thus bring up its students into genuine patriots and able specialists. By doing so, it can exalt its authority and fame as the dignified university of the Republic’s overseas citizens. In the present situation when the younger generation is 7 emerging as the leading force of the patriotic movement of Chongryon, the future of the movement of Koreans in Japan depends on how these young people are brought up. Chongryon should train them into reliable successors who will invariably, whatever the trials, carry forward the cause of Chongryon, a patriotic legacy bequeathed by the great leaders. The Korean Youth League in Japan, the Association of Korean Young Men of Commerce in Japan and the Union of Korean Students in Japan should add brilliance to the priceless inheritance bequeathed to them by the preceding generations and lead the young Korean compatriots always to live honourably, keeping in mind that they are Koreans by origin. The Union of Democratic Korean Women in Japan should intensify its work with the women compatriots of the younger generation so that they preserve the national identity of the Korean community and carry forward the proud tradition of turning one of the wheels of the patriotic movement of Chongryon. Businesspeople, a basic section of the masses under Chongryon and the main force in the movement of Koreans in Japan, should be actively enlisted in the patriotic work of Chongryon. The Federation of Korean Men of Commerce in Japan and other business organizations should protect and render wholehearted assistance to the compatriots in their commercial and business activities, and thus ensure that they work with great vigour. By helping to hasten the prosperity and development of their socialist motherland and national reunification, Chongryon and our compatriots in Japan should perform the mission and patriotic duty they have assumed before the country and the nation. They should devote their patriotic efforts to the sacred cause of achieving the prosperity of their socialist motherland. The destiny of our overseas compatriots is linked with that of 8 their motherland; when their motherland becomes strong, the prestige of their organizations and of they themselves is enhanced. Chongryon officials and our compatriots in Japan should champion the dignity and prestige of their socialist motherland in every way possible, and contribute to building a thriving socialist nation, those with strength dedicating their strength, those with knowledge devoting their knowledge and those with money donating their money. They should uphold the three charters for national reunification, the June 15 Joint Declaration and the October 4 Declaration, and wage the national reunification movement dynamically. Chongryon should strengthen national unity with Koreans affiliated with Mindan (pro-south Korean Federation of Korean Residents in Japan), and support and encourage the just struggle of their fellow countrymen in south Korea for independence, democracy and national reunification. Based on the ideals of independence, peace and friendship, Chongryon should develop friendly ties with progressive people from various strata and other people in Japan so as to create on its own initiative an environment and conditions favourable for its work and the movement of Koreans in Japan and help promote DPRK-Japan relations. For the moment, in ushering in a new golden age of the movement of Koreans in Japan, Chongryon should establish a well-regulated system for its work and improve its guidance methods in keeping with the changed situation and environment. The Central Committee of Chongryon should, on the principle of democratic centralism, consistently carry out the tasks it has discussed and decided on, and intensify its unified guidance over its subordinate organizations, affiliates and other organs at all levels to ensure that they work in a lively manner and fulfil all their tasks. The prefectural headquarters of 9 Chongryon should establish proper discipline and order so that they carry out the decisions and directives of the Central Committee by relying on the collective wisdom, and discharge their responsibilities and perform their role as regional leadership units of the movement of Koreans in Japan. The central leadership bodies of the affiliates and other organs of Chongryon should establish a well-regulated system of working in line with their characteristics, and bring guidance and assistance closer to their subordinate units so that they perform with credit the patriotic work in their respective fields. It is important to improve the work methods as demanded by the actual situation of Chongryon and the realities of the Korean community. By means of innovative insight, a fresh style of work and seasoned and experienced methods of work, Chongryon’s organizations, affiliates and other organs at all levels should create a new spirit, a new feature of the movement of Koreans in Japan that is advancing full of vigour and vitality. Whether a new golden age of the movement of Koreans in Japan is ushered in or not depends on the role of Chongryon officials. Chongryon officials, regarding the instructions of the great leaders as guidelines in their work and life, should always go among the masses of the compatriots and become organizers and motivators who share good times and bad with them, and enlist their spiritual strength. Maintaining the compatriots-first principle, they should display the spirit of boundless devotion and self-sacrifice in working for the national rights and happy future of their compatriots in Japan, who will thus regard Chongryon as their mother’s embrace and sincerely trust, love and rely on it. Chongryon is part of the socialist DPRK and the Koreans 10 resident in Japan are brothers and sisters and family members of the motherland. Our Party and the government of the Republic will take care, on its own responsibility, of the destiny and future of Chongryon, which the great President and General bequeathed, and of the Koreans resident in Japan, and do their best for the development of the movement of Koreans in Japan. I firmly believe that Chongryon officials and all other Korean compatriots in Japan will, in the future, too, throw in their lot with their socialist motherland and fulfil their honourable responsibilities and duties in their efforts to usher in a new golden age of the movement of Koreans in Japan.",delighted chongryon general association resident japan greet anniversary founding

26.07.2015,Kim Jong-un,"Dear war veterans attending the Fourth National Conference of War Veterans, Other veterans of the Fatherland Liberation War and people who performed meritorious wartime service across the country, I extend warm congratulations to you as we prepare to mark July 27, V-day for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, our glorious motherland. And I extend noble respects to the martyrs of the Korean People’s Army and the Chinese People’s Volunteers who laid down their precious lives in the sacred war for the freedom and independence of the country, and for peace. The Fourth National Conference of War Veterans held today in grand style to mark the 62nd anniversary of victory in the great Fatherland Liberation War is a celebration demonstrating to the world the glorious tradition of victory of our country that has always emerged victorious in the anti-imperialist revolutionary wars under the command of the great leaders; it is also a significant meeting that demonstrates the revolutionary determination of all our service personnel and people to achieve a new, great victory of the great Paektusan nation by inheriting the heroic fighting spirit displayed by their forerunners. Availing myself of this significant opportunity, I extend the noblest tribute and greatest glory to the great Comrade Kim Il Sung who led to victory two revolutionary wars, against the US and Japanese imperialist powers, and to the great General Kim Jong Il who achieved one victory after another in the unprecedented war to defend socialism. My noblest respects and warm and militant greetings go also to the anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters who, faithfully supporting the leadership of the great leaders, safeguarded the 1 people’s country and created the miracle of heroic Korea in achieving victory in the war, and to the war veterans attending this conference and across the country and the people of wartime merits who defeated the US-led allied imperialist forces and achieved great victory in the fierce Fatherland Liberation War. I also offer my noble respects to the veterans of the Chinese People’s Volunteers who fought shoulder to shoulder with our People’s Army soldiers at the cost of their blood for the freedom and independence of the Korean people and for peace in the East, and thus rendered assistance to us in our righteous revolutionary war. July 27 is our second Day of Liberation when our people defended with honour their country’s dignity and sovereignty from the brigandish aggression by the US imperialists, and also the day of proud victors that put the US imperialists, who were recklessly attempting to gain hegemony in the world and enslave it, on a downhill passage towards ruin. Less than two years after its founding, our Republic inflicted an ignominious defeat on the United States that had been boasting of being the “strongest” in the world, thus defending its national sovereignty and global peace and security. This was a military miracle unprecedented in the history of human warfare and a great feat of historical significance never seen before in the nation’s history spanning 5 000 years. The Fatherland Liberation War, in which the Korean people confronted the haughty US imperialists who had grown fat on aggression and pillage, was in fact a hard fight that could be likened to a bare-handed man facing brigandish robbers. The world’s people did not anticipate that the former would emerge as the winner in this war, which was in effect a confrontation between rifle and atomic bomb. Contrary to expectations, our service personnel and people safeguarded their homeland in this three-year-long, do-or-die 2 fight, and our country became widely known as a heroic nation, a miraculous nation, that prevented the outbreak of a new world war. Comrades, More than 60 years have passed since the day when fireworks were set off in celebration of victory over the arrogant US imperialists, with their Stars and Stripes burning and the flag of our Republic flying high. In the long period that has witnessed changes of generations and centuries our country has been at the forefront of the anti-US struggle, with the dark clouds of aggression and war constantly hovering over this land, and the political situation in the world has changed remarkably. Notwithstanding this, our service personnel and people are demonstrating their dignity as the guardians of independence and our country remains a bulwark of anti-imperialist independence and peace. The United States has sustained one humiliating reverse after another since the 1950s–this has become its shameful tradition. By contrast, our heroic Korea is proud of its tradition of dealing it a telling blow whenever the overbearing power threatens to run amuck. Our country’s glorious history and tradition of victory have resulted from the Juche-oriented military ideas, adroit strategy and tactics, and outstanding art of command of the heaven-sent legendary generals Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, as well as the heroic spirit and indomitable struggle of our service personnel and people who are boundlessly faithful to their Party and their leaders. No force can conquer the service personnel and people who, in support of their great leader, have turned out in the struggle to defend their country with confidence in the justice of their 3 cause and their own strength–this is a law and a truth taught by history. There can be neither today without yesterday nor tomorrow without today. Our war veterans are witnesses to the strength of heroic Korea and its history that is resplendent with victory; they are also the country’s priceless treasures representative of the era named after the great leaders. Our Party respects them not only as death-defying defenders of the country but also as laudable revolutionary elders and educators who instil the spirit of death-defying defence of the country in the ranks of their successors as they march forward towards final victory, and it pays high tribute to them. They are laudable heroes of our nation and genuine patriots, in that they dedicated their youth and even their lives to defending the Party, the revolution, the country and the people. The images of the generation who won victory in the war are etched on the minds of our people, including the young generation, as sung and unsung heroes; among them Ri Su Bok, Kang Ho Yong, An Yong Ae and many others sacrificed their lives for their one and only motherland. But for the generation of our heroic grandfathers and fathers who blocked enemy pillboxes with their chests and became human bombs to combat the enemy aircraft and tanks in defence of every inch of the country, this dignified and powerful socialist country, where people are enjoying happiness under the leadership of the Workers’ Party for generation after generation, would not have existed. Time has passed and rivers and mountains have changed, but the legendary tales of the feats of arms performed by the People’s Army warriors who defeated the aggressors with the unyielding mettle and emerged victors and the bloody footprints they left 4 can never be forgotten or erased, but will shine more brilliantly in the prospering country. The heroic fighters of the 1950s demonstrated through practice that a people who are strong in spirit are fully capable of defeating an imperialist aggressor army armed even with A-bombs. What our service personnel and people trusted absolutely and relied on in the confrontation with the allied imperialist forces that were numerically and technically superior was the Supreme Headquarters where the legendary hero Comrade Kim Il Sung was, and the source of their world-startling, unparalleled bravery was their ardent love for their motherland, burning hatred for the enemy and the revolutionary spirit of Paektu of fighting the enemy to the death. The US imperialists, who had been boasting of the myth of their “strength,” launched a series of desperate attacks by hurling in colossal amounts of military hardware and even the troops of their vassal countries, but they could never dishearten our service personnel and people who were filled with trust in and affection for what was theirs; the aggressive barbarians could not avoid staggering political and military, spiritual and moral defeats in the whole period of the war. The spirit of defending the country created in the flames of the war–this is the most powerful strength that defies comparison with any physical strength and the most precious asset our new generation should inherit from the war veterans who are strong in ideology and faith. The great leaders valued and held up the war veterans, who were trained and tested in the crucible of war, as the core of the Party and of the revolutionary ranks. After the war, the war veterans and people who had performed meritorious service in wartime continuously brought 5 the flowers of the revolution into bloom, devoting their blood and sweat unsparingly for the sake of the prosperity and development of the country, enjoying the great trust of the Party and the leaders. The epics of heroic feats in the Chollima era when Koreans demonstrated their true mettle once again in the flames of great upsurge and the proud annals recording their endeavours to build a socialist power that is independent, self-sufficient and self-reliant in national defence, tell of the valuable devotion of the generation of victors who faithfully supported the Party’s cause, tightening their belts in order to carry out the shares of their fallen comrades-in-arms as well as their own. War veterans braved the severe ordeals of the Arduous March and forced march, consistently throwing in their lot with the Party both in the days of trials and in the days of glory, and they have imparted to the rising generations the strong faith that they must invariably travel the long road of the Songun revolution, following the Party. Their ennobling spiritual world is an exemplary revolutionary trait which everyone should learn from. It is our great pride and a source of strength that we have as our revolutionary elders the war veterans who performed undying exploits in the great war to defend the country and in the gigantic socialist construction and who are handing such a superb ideological and spiritual wealth down to the coming generations. As it has such excellent people as you who, like the anti-Japanese war veterans, have gone through fire and water in support of the Party and the leader and encouraged the ranks of the people on the general onward march throughout their life with the attitude as befitting steadfast revolutionary soldiers, our Party always feels assured. The war veterans have devoted their entire life to the 6 independent reunification and prosperity of their country in single-hearted support of the great leaders and the Party since the days when they braved the flames of war. Their ennobling fighting spirit and splendid patriotic feats will shine brilliantly in permanent golden letters in the history of the heroic struggle of our people. Comrades, To glorify for generation after generation the immortal exploits of the great leaders in achieving victory in the war and leading the Songun revolution and stoutly to carry forward the heroic fighting spirit, the spirit of defending the country, displayed by our revolutionary forerunners including the war veterans is a major strategic policy maintained by our Party in its effort to put an end to the anti-imperialist, anti-US showdown and hasten the final victory of the Korean revolution. The spirit of defending the country displayed by the fighters in the 1950s is a great spirit of the times that inherited the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, and the spirit of Songun Korea which imbues all the service personnel and people with ardent patriotism and inspires them to achieve heroic feats. That we annually celebrate V-day on a large scale is aimed at congratulating the war veterans, our revolutionary forerunners, while adding glory to their heroic life, and at firmly arming all the officers and men of the People’s Army and the people, including the younger generation, with the spirit displayed by the defenders of the country in the 1950s so as to encourage them in the grand struggle to create a new speed of Korea. We should hold fast to the spirit of defending the country displayed in the 1950s as a fine textbook for the anti-imperialist class struggle and an ideological and spiritual weapon for adding lustre to the history and traditions of heroic Korea, and we should fully demonstrate its might in the anti-imperialist, anti-US 7 confrontation and in the final battle for victory in building a thriving country. War veterans, just as they did in the days when they sang revolutionary songs in the burning trenches, picturing in their minds the Supreme Headquarters, should support the Party and the country with unabated ardour and vigour, and hand down to the coming generations the pure, single-hearted loyalty, the revolutionary faith to be kept to their dying breath and the indomitable spirit of defending the country as their life and soul. The spirit of defending the country and the revolution displayed by the heroic soldiers in the days of the war should become a pillar of faith for all the officers and men of the People’s Army; a revolutionary climate in which the People’s Army obeys without question the orders of the Supreme Commander should be firmly established as its first and foremost discipline; and ardent love for the country with which to defend every inch of the land to the death and the fighting spirit with which to annihilate the enemy without mercy should pervade the battle fields and drilling grounds where the campaign for winning the title of Guards Unit is underway. When the spirit of those who ensured wartime production by turning machine belts by hand and the mettle of those who dedicated themselves to increasing grain production, wartime transport and assistance to the front despite the enemy bombings prevail across the country, successive world-startling, miraculous innovations can be created on all fronts where an economic giant is being built, and the eye-opening reality of the whole country turning into “gold fields,” “gold seas” and “gold mountains” can be unfolded. Our Party attaches special importance to arming the rising generation, the young people, with the spirit of defending the country. The problem of young people is precisely the problem of 8 inheriting the revolution, and what is most important in carrying forward the revolutionary cause is to hand down the lineage of ideology and faith. By cherishing the spirit of defending the country created by their forerunners at the cost of their blood, our young people should respond heartily to their country’s call, just as the heroic soldiers did in the 1950s; they should volunteer, with burning patriotism, beautiful hopes and great ambitions, to stand at the frontline posts of the Songun revolution and work at grand construction sites, and display to the full the valour and spirit of the masters of the world’s proud youth power and the young vanguard of the Songun revolution. Respecting the war veterans along with the anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters as our precious revolutionary forerunners is a trait and tradition unique to the Korean revolutionaries. We should ensure that the social climate of giving preferential treatment to the war veterans and looking after them with devotion prevails across the country so that they feel no discomfort in life. In this way we can ensure that they, who defended our happy life of today, take pride in having participated in the Fatherland Liberation War, become more vigorous even though they are getting older and look back on their career with pride. The United States and its vassal forces are making a last-ditch attempt to stifle our Republic, seemingly oblivious to their ignominious defeat in the war in the 1950s and the lessons from their complete failure in the decades-long policy of hostility towards our country. If the enemy, forgetting the tradition governed by the laws of history, commit another reckless act of provocation against our Republic, our revolutionary armed forces will bury them in the grave of final ruin. 9 Our strength now is not what it was in the 1950s, when we had to fight with rifles in our hands against the US imperialists who were armed to the teeth. We now possess the strength with which to fight any form of warfare that may be chosen by the United States. We have the power to deter the United States from unleashing a nuclear war. Gone forever is the era when the United States blackmailed us with nuclear weapons; now the United States is no longer a source of threats and fear for us and we are the very source of the greatest threat and fear for it. This is the current reality. Independence is justice, and it is an inevitable historical outcome that justice emerges victorious. Our cause is just, and no force in the world can check the advance of our service personnel and people who are marching in high spirits, rallied single-heartedly behind the Party, cherishing as their invincible weapon the revolutionary spirit of Paektu and the spirit of defending the country displayed in the 1950s. Let us all fight vigorously for final victory.

11.10.2015,Kim Jong-un,"Heroic officers and men of the Korean People's Army and the Korean People's Internal Security Forces, Officers and men of the units participating in the military parade held in celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the glorious Workers' Party of Korea, Members of the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and Young Red Guards, Respected Pyongyang citizens, Party members and other working people across the country, Overseas compatriots and foreign friends, Comrades, Today, with great pride in and joy of being victors, we are greeting the October holiday, flying high the flag of the Workers' Party of Korea in the sky. For our country and people, October 10 is a meaningful revolutionary holiday when they celebrate the birth anniversary of the genuine vanguard of the revolution, its militant General Staff, which has taken responsibility for their destiny and leads them. Today's grand military parade and public procession will fully display the inexhaustible strength which our Party has built up over the past 70 years by leading the service personnel and people. It will also demonstrate to the whole world the revolutionary spirit of all our service personnel and people who, full of courage and conviction, are advancing towards a bright future, united solidly around the Workers' Party of Korea. Availing myself of this meaningful opportunity, when we are proudly looking back upon the sacred history of the Workers' Party of Korea that is resplendent with victory and glory, I would like to extend, reflecting the boundless reverence and loyalty of the millions of members of our Party and all service personnel and people, the noblest respect and infinite glory to the great Comrade Kim Il Sung who founded our glorious Party and the great Comrade Kim Jong Il who is the eternal General Secretary of our dignified Workers' Party of Korea. My noble respect also goes to the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners, martyrs of the People's Army and other patriotic martyrs who dedicated all their precious things to promoting the development of our Party and the prosperity of the country in loyal support of the great leaders. Our people, with unfailing loyalty to the Party, have tided over all challenges and difficulties in the red revolutionary spirit of Paektu to glorify the 70th anniversary of its founding as a revolutionary, auspicious event, thereby performing unequalled feats of labour and preparing gifts dedicated to their motherly Party. As I am standing in the square of victors, the venue for celebrations, which is brimming over with our people's fervent loyalty, I am so grateful to them for this venue of today which would have been unimaginable separated from them, and at this moment I am seeing the dear people with deep respect. Our Party has been able to propel the revolution over the past 70 years without flinching whatever the storms, achieving only victory and glory, because this great people have entrusted their own destiny entirely to it and followed it in faithful support of its cause. The history of our Party is just the path travelled by our great people, its might is their might, its greatness is their greatness, and its victory is the victory achieved by them. On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Party I, on behalf of the Workers' Party of Korea, extend warm thanks with a deep bow to all the beloved people who have infused our Party with inexhaustible strength and courage and remained faithful to it in every grave period of the revolution, sharing weal and woe with it in overcoming the harsh trials of history by dint of unyielding willpower. My heartfelt congratulations and warm thanks go to our trustworthy members of the Party, heroic officers and men of the People's Army and laudable young vanguard, who, in hearty response to the Party's appeal, have worked with patriotic devotion and created one heroic miracle after another shortening ten years to one on all fronts of building a thriving socialist nation, so as proudly to enter the venue of the grand festival of victors. At the same time I warmly welcome our overseas compatriots and foreign friends who are here to congratulate our people on this auspicious day. Comrades, The history of the Workers' Party of Korea is a proud course it has traveled shouldering the destiny of the people and leading the Korean revolution to victory under the guidance of the great leaders. President Kim Il Sung and General Kim Jong Il built ours into an invincible revolutionary party, a genuine political leadership organization, which serves the people and advances in unity with the masses, the first of its kind in history. Since it inscribed a hammer, a sickle and a writing brush in its red flag, our Party has never been separated from the people and advanced the revolution always believing in them as in heaven. History records no revolution as ours that has braved at every step the grave trials and adversities decisive of its success in such an arduous and complicated situation. The new Korea was too young, but the US imperialists, hell-bent on world supremacy, forced a devastating war upon it; when we rebuilt the country on the debris with so much effort tightening our belts, they presented a fresh threat of aggression; and when we were trying to develop our national economy, they blocked our road by imposing the sanctions and blockade unprecedented in history. Despite all the difficulties, our Party has always charged forward with iron nerves in any adversity, ushered in a new age of epoch-making changes on this land, and scored only great victories. In the whirlwind of history, our Party has trusted our great people only, and they have been its only supporters, advisers and assistants. The history of the world revolutionary movement teaches the lesson that irrespective of whether it is a ruling one or has a long history, the leadership authority and fighting efficiency of a party do not rise of their own accord nor can it lead the revolution effectively. The high authority our Party enjoys today and the great exploits it has performed are the fruition of the brilliant revolutionary ideas and outstanding leadership of the great President and General, who formulated the revolution as the affection for and trust in the people and applied this definition to its building and activities in a thoroughgoing way. In having struck its roots deep into the people's mind and served them only with devotion lies the secret of our Party's leading the cause of independence, Songun and socialism without letup in the face of the tribulations of history while maintaining a firm grip on the steering wheel of the revolution. The Workers' Party of Korea is an invincible one that has achieved oneness with the masses of the people. In the whole period of leading the revolution, our Party used to call the people first, lend an ear to their opinions, though simple, and draw unquenchable courage from their sincerity whenever it was trying to identify a course it must follow and whenever it faced grave trials. The creative strength of the omnipotent masses was the source of the great miracles our Party worked while building a powerful socialist bulwark, independent, self-supporting and self-reliant in national defence, on this land where centuries-old backwardness and poverty had prevailed and ushering in a new era of building a powerful country in the face of pernicious blockade imposed by the imperialists. Bearing full responsibility for the political integrity and material and cultural life of the people and taking care of them has been a matter of paramount importance for our Party and a mission it cannot neglect even for a moment. That our Party, even in the worst situation decisive of the country's destiny, has prepared precious seeds and socialist assets for the happiness of the people through painstaking efforts and invariably pursued the people-oriented policies is an expression of the politics of love for the people that can be administered only by our Party that has shouldered the responsibility for their destiny. As our Party has always regarded the masses of the people as the root of its life and as the source of its inexhaustible strength and given top and absolute priority to their interests, our people have followed it believing it as the genuine guiding light of their destiny and as their mother, and a grand flower garden of single-hearted unity has made its proud appearance on this land. Comrades, The might of the Workers' Party of Korea which struggles for the people lies in the fact that it has powerful revolutionary armed forces. Our people have keenly realized the truth that a people without arms is destined to become a ruined nation and that their dignity and happiness are guaranteed by revolutionary arms. Our Party has always channelled primary efforts into building invincible military strength with which it can creditably defend the security of the people and their lives and property. Thanks to our Party's original line of self-reliant defence and Songun politics, the People's Army has been developed into an elite revolutionary army that is capable of defeating any aggressor forces at a stroke, and the all-people and all-country defence system consolidated steadily, with the result that our country has now turned into an impregnable fortress, into a world-class military power. Our revolutionary armed forces have always been a powerful treasured sword in defending the country, the revolution and the people, and a mighty vanguard force and shock brigade that takes the lead in the struggle for the country's prosperity and people's happiness. In the course of organically combining defence of the country with socialist construction after putting forward the line of promoting economic construction and building up defence capabilities in parallel, our Party gained valuable experience in radically increasing the overall national strength by itself and at the same time improving the people's standard of living even though it lacked in everything. In direct confrontation with the high-handed U.S. imperialists who have fattened themselves through aggression and war, our service personnel and people have inflicted one ignominious defeat after another upon them and are forcefully breaking through the brigandish sanctions and blockade by imperialist forces. Their indomitable spirit and strength of unity strike extreme anxiety and fear into the enemy. Today our Party can proudly state that our revolutionary armed forces are capable of fighting any type of war the U.S. imperialists opt for, and have made full preparations for firmly defending the blue sky over the country and the security of the people. Comrades, The source of the unique pride for the Workers' Party of Korea is the large contingent of young people who have been trained to shoulder the future of the revolution and the nation. Foreseeing the protracted nature of the revolution in the initial period of its founding, our Party set attaching importance to young people as its strategic line and has trained them into warriors for the implementation of the cause of the Juche revolution. The entire Party has paid constant concern to educating young people and boldly tasked the youth league with large projects. Under the trust and affection of the Party that has put them forward as its young vanguard our young people have volunteered in every period of the revolution to serve at the posts for national defence and work in difficult and challenging sectors, and displayed their youthful wisdom and courage to the full. That our revolution is still advancing vigorously filled with unflagging energy and vitality without stagnation and marking time is because it has a steel-strong legion of young people who always march straight forward following the Party. The proud and grand youth monuments in various parts of the country, including the Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station, which our young people have recently set up by devoting their patriotic sweat and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of Party founding graphically show how the reserve force of the Workers' Party of Korea is being prepared and how the lineage of the Korean revolution is being carried forward. As our Party has spared nothing for young people, our country has now greeted a fresh heyday in the youth movement and is demonstrating its might as the one and only great youth power, in which the youth problem has been solved perfectly. The historical course our Party has travelled leading the Korean revolution to victory through thick and thin eloquently proves that there is nothing to be afraid of and there is nothing impossible if there are a people faithful to their party and a powerful revolutionary army and large contingent of young people. The lifeline of a revolutionary party, its strength and its bright future are dependent on attaching importance to the people, to the army and to young people – this is just the invaluable summing up of the 70-year history of our Party. By continuing to hold fast to the three-point strategy of attaching importance to the people, to the army and to young people as its foremost weapon, our Party will advance forward vigorously towards final victory and accomplish the Korean revolution. Comrades, The Workers' Party of Korea organizes and guides all the victories of our people. The infinite glory and invincibility of our Party originate from holding up the great President and General as its eternal leaders and enjoying absolute support and trust of all the Korean people. If our Party is to lead Korea to a bright future, it must invariably defend its revolutionary nature as the party of the great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism both in name and in reality and exalt its brilliance in every way. The great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is, in essence, the people-first principle, and the mode of existence of our Party is serving the people. True to the ennobling intentions of the great President and General who administered for the first time in history the politics of prioritizing, respecting and loving the people and devoted their all throughout their lives to the good of the people, our Party will, in the future, too, strive to add glory to the sacred history of the people-first principle. The entire Party will conduct its building and activities only as instructed by the great President and General, and make selfless, devoted efforts for the benefit of the people by thoroughly applying the people-first principle to its overall work, thereby enhancing its fighting efficiency in every way possible. The genuine feature of the Workers' Party of Korea will be expressed in the appearance of the country that is transformed under its leadership and in the looks of the people who always smile happily. The people are the most precious as they constitute the foundation of the country, and nothing is more sacred than their interests. Our Party will cherish the people's sincere loyalty to it as the greatest asset of the revolution and bring earlier everything splendid of the future by shouldering all the burdens and clearing a thorny path for the sake of our brave, resourceful and beautiful people. It will, in the future, too, endeavour to fulfil its heavy yet sacred mission as a motherly party that, full of infinite vitality and untiring zeal, invariably works with affection for the people and devotes its all to their interests. It will also remain boundlessly faithful to its basic duty of taking full responsibility for their destiny whatever the storms. The Korean revolution advances not by dint of any mysterious divine power but on the great strength of our people including the heroic Kim Il Sung's and Kim Jong Il's working class who follow and safeguard their Party with a single mind. The Party respects and believes in the people as in heaven and regards them as its mentors, and they boundlessly trust and follow it as they would do their mothers–this single-hearted unity is precisely the true appearance of Korea and the great foundation of the Songun revolution. Our officials should imbue their hearts with the Party's intention of respecting the people and its affection for them, be infinitely polite to them and clear a path, whether snowy or muddy, to realize all their wishes. In this way they can ensure that cheers for the Workers' Party, for the single-hearted unity and for socialism resound throughout the country. It is our Party's belief that all its members, service personnel and working people, regarding their workplaces, military posts and villages as those in the garden of the office of its Central Committee and always sharing their innermost thoughts with it, will fully display their unstained loyalty and patriotism in the efforts to implement its ideas and defend its policies. Comrades, Our Party will make proactive and persevering efforts to bring earlier the bright day of national reunification, the greatest wish of the Korean nation, resolutely frustrating all sorts of obstructive schemes by foreign forces by dint of single-hearted unity and Songun. Comrades, As the working people exist for ever, lasting justice and victory will be ensured by the struggle for the people and together with the people. Regarding as a paragon the noble ideas and achievements of the great President and General, who devoted their whole life to training the people by believing in them as in heaven and exalted the brilliance of Korea, our Party will continue to love the people and fight for them, and strive to translate their beautiful dreams and ideals into reality. Any challenges of history and frantic attempts by the enemy will never check the advance of our service personnel and people, who have achieved oneness with the Party, nor can they slow down the fighting speed of the Korean people, who are rushing forward towards a bright future, regarding the Party's revolutionary ideology and the blizzards of Paektu as the motive power for advance and the red flag of our dignified Party as the sail. The world will see vividly how the Workers' Party of Korea gives full play to the strength and wisdom of our great people and builds a great Paektusan nation, which will be most prosperous and powerful on this planet. As the great Workers' Party of Korea that believes in the people as in heaven, the people who are one and the same with the name of our sacred revolution and its 70 years of victory, is the locomotive leading the revolution and holds the switch weight of history, the avenue of the cause of the Juche revolution will always be adorned with victory and glory. I appeal to all the Party members. Let us all make selfless, devoted efforts for the good of the great people.

20.11.2015,Kim Jong-un,"In this stirring period when the whole Party, the entire army and all the people have turned out in a general offensive in hearty response to the Party’s militant call to mark the Seventh Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea as a pinnacle of the revolution and a milestone in its history, the Fourth Conference of Frontrunners in the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement is being held, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the launch of this movement. This conference will be an important occasion in dynamically stepping up the building of a thriving socialist country by further raising the fierce flames of the movement in line with the demands of the developing revolution. The great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il proposed this movement and ensured that the three revolutions–ideological, technological and cultural–were conducted vigorously in all sectors of the revolution and construction. By doing so they performed imperishable exploits for accomplishing the cause of the Juche revolution, the cause of building a thriving socialist country. For the first time in history Comrade Kim Il Sung put forward the idea of continuing the revolution in the realms of ideology, technology and culture even after the socialist system was established. He presented the revolution in these realms as the strategic line in socialist construction, and worked out a plan for conducting a three-revolution red flag movement as a mass movement for implementing the strategic line. This movement, as a development of the Chollima Workteam Movement, was a historic starting point for bringing about a radical turn in the transformation of people and the construction of socialism by organically combining the effort to conduct the three 1 revolutions with other mass movements. True to the ennobling intention of Comrade Kim Il Sung, Comrade Kim Jong Il kindled the flames of the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement and provided energetic guidance to it. He subsequently recorded brilliant successes in carrying out the three revolutions. Today our people have grown into a highly dignified, independent motive force for the revolution, and our country is charging ahead to attain the status of a knowledge-based economy and a civilized power, demonstrating to the whole world its might as a politico-ideological power and a world military power. This is an invaluable result Comrade Kim Jong Il achieved by regarding the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement as a powerful weapon in carrying out the cause of the Juche revolution, and wisely leading the movement. I extend warm thanks and militant greetings, in the name of the Workers’ Party of Korea, to all those attending this conference and to the Order of the Three-Revolution Red Flag laureates and merited persons of the Songun era across the country who have rendered great service to building a prosperous country by dynamically waging the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement with unfailing loyalty to the Party and the leaders. Today we are faced with the heavy task of building a thriving socialist country within a short period by bringing about a revolutionary turn in the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement, in line with the demands of the new era of the Juche revolution. This movement is a powerful engine for building a thriving country and a mighty weapon for achieving final victory in the cause of the Juche revolution earlier. The struggle to build a thriving country is, in essence, a struggle to transform all the domains of ideology, technology and culture in line with the demands of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. 2 The process of building a thriving country, the process of bringing about great, miraculous changes by setting the highest possible goals for comprehensively realizing the people’s dreams and ideals and by blazing a trail to this end, is a process of training the people, the motive force of this effort, into genuine revolutionaries who are firmly armed with the Juche idea and the Songun idea, who are possessed of great spiritual strength. It is also a struggle to develop the national economy radically on the strength of science and technology and create the highest quality and standard of civilization. Only by waging the ideological, technological and cultural revolutions dynamically can we consolidate to the full the strength of the country as a politico-ideological, military and youth power and reach the objective of achieving the status of an economic and civilized power at the highest speed. The line of the three revolutions as defined by the great leaders in an original way and applied by them is an ever-victorious banner with eternal viability and the general line to which our Party must hold fast in building socialism. In an attempt to halt our people’s struggle to build a thriving country, the imperialist reactionaries are now resorting to unprecedented schemes aimed at stifling our country. The showdown with them is a battle to overwhelm and defeat capitalism on all fronts–political, military, economic and cultural–by defending and glorifying our most advantageous ideology and culture and consolidating the might of our Juche-based science and technology in every way. When we make a continuous advance and continuous innovations under the unfurled banner of the revolution in the three realms of ideology, technology and culture, the cause of the Juche revolution and the cause of the Songun revolution pioneered on Paektu will achieve victory after victory by overcoming all the challenges and trials. 3 This is an important period when Korea’s revolutionaries must achieve the decisive victory of socialism over capitalism by flying higher the three red flags–ideological, technological and cultural–and fully discharge the grave mission and tasks they have assumed before the times and history. If we are to hasten final victory by implementing the line of the three revolutions, we must bring about a revolutionary turn in the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement. This movement is the highest form of movement, one that sets our Party’s ultimate programme of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism as its fighting slogan, and it is a mass movement involving the whole country and all the people. The Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement is permeated with our Party’s noble people-first idea of turning the revolution itself into ardent love for the people, training them into great beings and carrying out the revolution and construction by bringing their voluntary enthusiasm and creative wisdom into fullest play. Also incorporated into the movement are the offensive spirit of braving the obstacles and difficulties that crop up along the way of the revolution and the spirit of the red flag of Paektu, which is the spirit of making continuous innovations and a continuous advance with unyielding determination. No movement is more effective and more powerful than the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement in opening a short-cut to final victory by bringing about sweeping changes in the ideological, technological and cultural spheres. By waging the movement more dynamically, we can train all the members of society into genuine Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists, solidify the political and military position of our revolution and accelerate the building of an economic giant and civilized power. In this way we can build on this land a thriving socialist country 4 with great national strength, where prosperity flourishes and the people are living without any cause for envy. Now, however, the movement is not being conducted at the appropriate level as suited to the development of the times and the demands of the Party. Such practices as giving precedence to renovating buildings over the ideological remoulding of people and production have yet to be eliminated in the movement, and some defeatist units are not engaging in the movement proactively, blaming the poor conditions. Party guidance to the movement is failing to measure up to the demands of the developing reality, and such deviations are still evident as giving guidance in a formalistic way, snared in stereotypes and set patterns. This has resulted in the movement failing to give full play to its vitality. To surmount these deviations and bring about a radical turn in the movement so that it safeguards and glorifies the immortal revolutionary exploits of the great leaders and hastens final victory in building a thriving country–this is the intention of our Party and the objective of this conference. All Party organizations should be clearly aware of the Party’s intention and wage the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement more dynamically at a new high. They should assign proper tasks to be tackled in carrying out the three revolutions in line with the demands of the times when a general offensive for final victory is being conducted, and then undertake the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement aggressively to implement these tasks. Giving definite precedence to the ideological revolution is the fundamental principle consistently adhered to by our Party in the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement. Our Party has, throughout the period of its struggle to accomplish the cause of the Juche revolution, held fast to 5 ideology as the most powerful weapon of the revolution and advanced the revolution and construction victoriously on the strength of it. That the red flag of the revolution which was flying in the forests of Paektu has not lost its colour in the least but is still flying as the banner of socialism is due to the fact that we have invariably prioritized ideology. Any discoloration of ideology leads to the fading of the red flag. We should always remember that the success of the revolution and the future of the country are dependent on ideological work, and should continue to direct great efforts to the ideological revolution. The most important task in the ideological revolution at present is to train all the members of society into genuine Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists who have acquired the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu, as their nature. By Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists I mean persons with great spiritual strength who cherish boundless loyalty to the ideas and cause of their leaders and the spirit of making selfless, devoted efforts for the good of the people and who are ready to fight to the last with indomitable revolutionary faith and will for the final victory of the Juche revolution. Party organizations should conduct brisk ideological work, putting the main stress on training Party members and other working people into genuine Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists who have acquired the red revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu, as their nature. They should conduct substantive five-point education with the main emphasis on education in the greatness of the leaders. Education in this greatness, in Kim Jong Il’s patriotism, in revolutionary faith, in anti-imperialism and class consciousness, and in socialist morality can be called an ideological “chisel” and “hammer” for inscribing on the hearts of the people the 6 revolutionary outlook on the leader, ardent love for the country, unwavering faith, steadfast class awareness and an ennobling outlook on morality. Party organizations should conduct the five-point education in various forms and by various methods. In this way they can train all officials, Party members and other working people into indomitable vanguard fighters who hold the great leaders in the highest esteem eternally as the Sun of Juche and implement their instructions and the Party’s policies to the last, and into individuals with steadfast faith and morality who are ready to give their all for the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people with unshakeable faith and sound anti-imperialist, class awareness. They should channel their efforts into conducting ideological work in novel and lively ways in conformity with the characteristics and actual conditions of their respective units. By setting up effective bases for education such as rooms for education in revolutionary exploits and rooms dedicated to the history of their units, and by conducting effective education through them, they should ensure that officials, Party members and other working people are well-informed of those leadership exploits of the great leaders and the Party that are associated with their sectors and units and learn from the laudable examples of their revolutionary forerunners who supported the Party and the leaders faithfully. In this way officials, Party members and other working people can be encouraged to confide themselves to the Party whenever necessary regarding their units as the garden of the offices of the Party Central Committee and display to the full pure patriotism and loyalty in the struggle to implement the Party’s ideas and defend its policies. Ideological and motivation work should be conducted in conformity with the characteristics of the jobs done by the employees of their units and their 7 preparedness, and the heartstrings of the masses touched by conducting frontline-style political work at the workplace–in the factory or on farmland. Party organizations should orient their ideological work towards increasing the might of collectivism. Socialist ideology is based on collectivism, and the ability of the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement to display its vitality depends on the might of the unity of the collective, all of whose members are firmly armed with the Party’s ideology. When they join efforts with a single mind, a radical improvement will be brought about in ideological remoulding, and the spiritual strength of the masses can give a powerful impetus to carrying out the technological and cultural revolutions. Our Party intends to write a new chapter in the history of the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement by developing the collectivist spirit in accordance with the requirements of the present times, the spirit which was characteristic of the Chollima era and the campaign for grand socialist construction in which the people put the interests of their comrades and the collective before their own and made collective innovations by educating and reforming those who were lagging behind. Party organizations should stress giving full play to the ideological and volitional unity of the collective and revolutionary comradeship based on loyalty to the Party and the leaders. By doing so, they can prepare all officials and all the working people as incarnations of loyalty who, helping one another and leading one another forward, carry out the revolutionary tasks entrusted to them by the Party within the time set and at the standard demanded by it, and encourage them to create a great epic of mass heroism in our times by means of collective innovation. They should also launch a vigorous struggle to get rid of the selfish and non-socialist practices that 8 are evident in some aspects of social life by relying on the united strength of the masses, and fully establish an atmosphere of leading an ideological life and observing moral discipline, as suited to the original features of socialism. All sectors and all units should regard science and technology as their lifeblood and make proactive efforts to put their production lines and enterprise management on a modern, IT footing in conformity with the actual conditions in our country–this is an important task to be tackled in carrying out the technological revolution at present. We should lay the foundations of a knowledge-based economy driven by modern science and technology and buttressed by hi-tech industries, and make the national economy Juche-oriented, modern, scientific and IT-based at a high standard. Party organizations at industrial establishments should ensure that they work out proper strategies for their business operation and enterprise management on the basis of scientific calculation, and that modern and IT means are actively introduced in production lines and enterprise management. It is important in modernizing industrial establishments not to adopt technology developed by other countries or install equipment imported from them; modernization should be realized by relying on our own forces, technology and equipment. They should build up their forces for themselves that are capable of developing science and technology, raise the proportion of domestic equipment, raw and other materials they use by promoting creative cooperation with the scientists and researchers at scientific and educational institutions, consolidate the existing foundations of production, and steadily upgrade their equipment and production lines. Party organizations in the agricultural sector should accelerate the pace of the technological revolution so as to ensure the full 9 implementation of the Party’s policy on bringing about a radical improvement in agriculture, raise the fierce flames of scientific farming and animal husbandry and realize the comprehensive mechanization of the rural economy. The vitality of the technological revolution should be manifested in the successful implementation of the national economic plan drawn up by the state and the major revolutionary tasks entrusted to each unit by it. By giving full play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and relying on the might of modern science and technology, all units should make regular leaps forward and innovations in production and construction and carry out the revolutionary tasks entrusted to them by the Party, thereby rendering an active contribution to building a prosperous country and improving the people’s standard of living. The present reality, in which a new phase of cultural flourishing in the era of the Workers’ Party is being opened up, shows that we can build a civilized socialist power of our style in a short period when the cultural revolution is spurred on. The many architectural structures and other proud creations that have sprung up across our country in recent days are emblematic of the highest quality of civilization which is the envy of the world, and the people’s cultural life is improving with each passing day. Holding high the slogan “Let the people enjoy the highest quality and standard of civilization!” we should step up the cultural revolution and build a civilized socialist power by our own efforts so that we can stand proud before the world. Party organizations should make sure that sci-tech learning spaces are built to the latest standard and that the advantages of the study-while-you-work system, including factory college, are brought into full play. Then they can train officials and the 10 working people into genuine revolutionaries who are masters of their respective sectors and fields and have acquired versatile knowledge, and thus carry out the Party’s policy on making all the people well-versed in science and technology. All sectors and all units should strive to transform their factories, workplaces, streets and villages into a socialist paradise so that they meet the requirements of the new century, retain their specific features and regional characteristics, and remain viable even in the distant future. They should encourage their employees to press ahead with the tree-planting campaign so as to cover the country’s mountains with greenery, and endeavour to afforest and landscape their units and home villages and turn them into orchards. By thoroughly implementing the Party’s policy on making sports and art mass-based, they should stir up all parts of the country to sing, dance and do colourful sports activities, and drum up support for the revolution, however tense the situation may be and whatever trials and difficulties they may face, so that an optimistic fighting spirit and lifestyle pervade the collective. They should thoroughly eliminate the alien lifestyle from among Party members and other working people, particularly the young people, and establish a socialist and national way of life among them. Turning the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement into an undertaking by the masses themselves is a fundamental requirement for vigorously promoting the ideological, technological and cultural revolutions. The lifeblood of a mass movement is that it becomes a movement by the masses themselves. Party organizations should make officials, Party members and other working people understand that energetically waging the movement is precisely an undertaking to implement the 11 instructions of Comrade Kim Jong Il and a worthwhile struggle to create their own happiness by their own efforts, so that they can all take part in the movement as one, as befits the masters of the movement. They should set realistic objectives for winning the Three-Revolution Red Flag title at different stages by fully reflecting the opinions of the masses; they should determine the proper order of priority and make scrupulous organizational and political arrangements to carry out their tasks one by one, beginning from what is feasible. By so doing, they can encourage everybody to turn out actively in the movement with confidence. Along with this, they should regard providing the working people with good working and living conditions as an important undertaking aimed at touching their hearts, and forcefully push ahead with it, thereby boosting their morale. Information and motivation work geared to raising the fierce flames of the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement should be conducted in an aggressive manner and a strong wind of collective competition be raised so as to make the social atmosphere run higher. Giving appropriate political incentives and material rewards is another important way of encouraging the masses to take part voluntarily in the movement. Party organizations should ensure that visits to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun are organized in a politically meaningful way for the employees of units which have been honoured with the Three-Revolution Red Flag to tell the great leaders about their achievements in carrying out the revolutionary tasks, and they should on a priority basis enjoy tours of Pyongyang, revolutionary battle sites and other historic places. At the same time, the hard core, who have been trained and examined in the course of the struggle to carry out the three revolutions, should be given prominence by admitting them to 12 the Party and awarding commendations, thereby inspiring them always to exalt their honour in being frontrunners in the movement. Material rewards should also be given to the units which have been honoured with the Three-Revolution Red Flag and the people who have been awarded the Order of the Three-Revolution Red Flag. Units that are associated with the leadership exploits of the Party and the great leaders should be the driving force in the effort to win the Three-Revolution Red Flag title. It is the traditional leadership mode of our Party to create model units and push ahead with the overall work by relying on them. We should set up the units visited by the leaders as models and, with them as an example, bring about leaps forward and innovations in the movement as a whole. The Party organizations at these units should make it their lifeblood to implement the instructions the great leaders gave them during their on-site guidance and raise the fierce flames of the three revolutions to make their units models in all aspects of ideology, technology and culture. The officials and working people at these units should be fully conscious of the honour and pride in working at places that bear the sacred footsteps of the great leaders, and display high revolutionary enthusiasm and creative activity in the effort to be awarded the Three-Revolution Red Flag. Party committees and administrative and economic organs at all levels should render active support to the units associated with the leadership exploits of the great leaders so that they can take the lead in carrying out the three revolutions. If they pay a little more attention to these units, the latter will be fully capable of standing in the vanguard of the struggle to carry out the three revolutions, since the great leaders clarified the ways and means for them. 13 Party committees at all levels, ministries and national agencies, all provinces, cities and counties should render proper assistance to the units associated with the undying revolutionary exploits of the great leaders so that they are all awarded the Three-Revolution Red Flag. Party committees should direct particular attention to the production units visited by the leaders, in keeping with the Party’s intention of giving top priority to improving the people’s living standards. Scrupulous Party guidance should be given to those units that have been honoured with the Three-Revolution Red Flag to ensure that they become two-time and three-time laureates of the honour. In this way they can propel the effort to build a thriving country and improve the people’s standard of living. It is important to enhance the role of working people’s organizations, administrative and economic organs and three-revolution team members in the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement. Since the movement is a struggle to carry out the general line of our Party, success in it depends on the active mobilization of all working people’s organizations and administrative and economic organs, as well as Party organizations. Working people’s organizations should conduct vigorous political work geared to enlisting all their members in the movement and thus ensure that they bring about a radical turn in carrying out the three revolutions at their units, becoming one in mind and purpose and effecting collective innovations. The youth league organizations, in particular, should encourage the young people to become point-men and a shock brigade achieving breakthroughs in the vanguard of the movement and, in the course of carrying out the three revolutions, nurture them as the political reserve force of the Workers’ Party of Korea and reliable masters of the youth power. 14 Administrative and economic organs should make detailed arrangements, as discussed and decided by their Party committees, for the three revolutions and carry out one by one in a planned way the tasks that have been decided on. The three-revolution team members should step up the technical upgrading and modernization of the production lines and equipment at their relevant units, so that the vitality of the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement can be demonstrated to the full in the ongoing general march, seething with the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu and the spirit of At a Go. Working people’s organizations should conduct various forms of mass movements effectively in combination with this movement. These mass movements differ from one another in their content, form and those involved, but their basic targets are all the same, in that they are designed to implement the great leaders’ instructions and the Party’s policies by stepping up the three revolutions–ideological, technological and cultural. Therefore, working people’s organizations should orient all forms of mass movements towards carrying out the three revolutions more effectively and push them forward vigorously. Party organizations should make another detailed review of the state of the mass movements conducted by these organizations and put to rights any wrong tendencies, so as to ensure that these movements contribute, as far as possible, to carrying on the three revolutions. By vigorously launching the movement to learn from merited individuals of the Songun era, we should inject vigour into the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement. This is a mass movement for instilling loyalty to the Party, ardent patriotism and the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude into the minds of Party members and other working people through education by means of exemplary individuals, so as to ensure that they turn out 15 in the campaign to carry out the instructions of the great leaders and champion the policies of the Party. Party organizations should push ahead dynamically with this movement and thus ensure that a larger number of patriots and performers of labour feats who cherish Kim Jong Il’s patriotism and give full play to their patriotic zeal and spirit of devoted service in the major theatres of the campaign for building an economic giant and improving the people’s living standards are produced, and that the movement makes an active contribution to developing the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement. To improve the role of Party committees decisively is a sure guarantee for bringing about a revolutionary turn in the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement at present. The Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement is a mass movement organized and guided by the Party on its own responsibility, so it is natural that Party committees take full charge of it and push ahead with it. Party organizations at all levels should make this movement an out-and-out concern of Party committees. Party committees should take direct charge of planning and arranging the undertakings related to the movement, and motivate all their departments and subordinate organizations to press ahead with it. Departments of Party committees at all levels should adopt the viewpoint and attitude that they share responsibility for undertakings related to the movement. In particular, the organizational leadership departments, information and publicity departments, working people’s organization departments and other relevant departments should work in close cooperation with one another. The information and publicity departments of Party committees at all levels should radically enhance their role. As the main departments of Party committees they are directly 16 responsible for guiding the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement. They should exercise unified control over the movement and push it forward in a planned and militant way so that the whole country seethes with passion for it. They should conduct a profound analysis of the current state of the movement and then work out concrete plans for developing it to the standard demanded by the Party and adopt proper measures to this end. They should intensify their guidance over their subordinate units in order to rectify any deviations promptly, and work responsibly and according to Party principles when recommending for the Three-Revolution Red Flag award and evaluating those units that claim to have achieved the objectives, true to their pledges. They should build up the ranks of officials in direct charge of the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement and decisively improve their political and practical qualifications. They should have a good understanding of the policies advanced by the Party in various periods, acquire a high-level grounding in modern science and technology and a rich knowledge for a cultural and emotional life, and take steps to improve their leadership abilities steadily. Party committees at all levels should appoint officials with a strong drive and resolve to these posts, and should not change their posts for a certain period of time. They should also re-evaluate the office mechanism with a view to providing more effective Party guidance to the movement, and adopt relevant measures. Senior officials of Party committees at all levels should fully discharge their revolutionary duty in guiding the movement. Their attitude towards the movement is their view of and stand on the instructions of Comrade Kim Jong Il, as well as a serious political issue related to their preparedness for continuing the revolution. Senior officials of Party committees at all levels are 17 commanders in direct charge of the movement. They are duty-bound to stand in the vanguard of the struggle in bringing about a fundamental turn in the movement, and should prove their loyalty to the Party with proud achievements in the three revolutions. They should inscribe on their hearts the Party’s intention to bring about a radical turn in the movement, personally take in hand the work of implementing that intention and push ahead with it in a revolutionary way. They should keep abreast of the present situation and progress in the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement at their own units and address and promptly correct any problems on their own initiative. They should render effective help to the officials who provide direct guidance to the movement to improve their level and abilities. They should make it their habit to go down regularly to the sites where the movement is being waged to learn about the concrete situation and adopt any measures necessary. For the present, they should push ahead with the organizational and political work for raising the fierce flames of the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement in the lead-up to the Seventh Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea. By doing so they can actively contribute to marking the congress with great achievements in carrying out the three revolutions and to glorifying it as a historic congress that will be recorded in the annals of our Party and country. The Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement is a militant undertaking that the great Comrade Kim Jong Il, General Secretary of the Workers’ Party of Korea, entrusted to Party organizations, based on his trust in them. I hope you will continuously display the honour of being frontrunners in carrying out the three revolutions and become the initial sparks and torches in raising the flames of the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement across the country, 18 bearing deep in mind the instructions of Comrade Kim Jong Il and the intentions of the Party on vigorously waging the movement. True to the Party’s intention, Party organizations at all levels, Party members and other working people should defend and glorify the immortal exploits of the great leaders and hasten the final victory of the Juche revolution by bringing about a revolutionary turn in the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement.",stirring period party entire army turn general offensive hearty response party

01.01.2016,Kim Jong-un,"Dear comrades, Filled with the dignity and self-respect of being victors, who have set up a shining milestone in the history of the glorious Workers’ Party of Korea and our country, we are greeting the New Year 2016. In reflection of the fervent loyalty of all the people and service personnel, I extend the noblest respect and New Year greetings to the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the symbol of socialist Korea and the sun of Juche. My New Year greetings also go to all the service personnel and people, who are working devotedly for the prosperity of their socialist country with a firm determination to follow the road of Juche to the end together with the Party, and I wish that all the families will be filled with harmonious feelings and the happy laughter of our dear children resound more loudly. Seeing in the New Year, I extend greetings to our compatriots in the south and abroad who are struggling to achieve national reunification, the cherished desire of the nation, and to the progressive peoples and our friends in the world who aspire after independence, justice and peace. The year 2015 was a year of gigantic struggle, which is adorned with meaningful events and eye-opening successes, a year of victory and glory, in which socialist Korea fully demonstrated its prestige and might. Last year we celebrated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Workers’ Party of Korea as a proud and significant revolutionary event of the great Paektusan nation. Having turned out as one in hearty response to the Party’s call, the service personnel and people waged a heroic struggle in the revolutionary spirit of Paektu and through bold army-people cooperation, thus bringing about proud labour results dedicated to the motherly Party. The Paektusan Hero Youth Power Station, Chongchongang Power Station in Tiers, Sci-Tech Complex, Mirae Scientists Street, Jangchon Vegetable Cooperative Farm and many other structures of lasting significance and beautiful socialist villages that embody the Party’s ideas and policies sprang up, showing the mettle of the country which is advancing by leaps and bounds reducing ten years to one. Our working class, scientists and technicians, true to the instructions of the great leaders, made a big stride in making the metallurgical industry Juche-based, built model, standard factories of the era of the knowledge-driven economy in various parts of the country and put production lines on a modern and IT footing, thus opening a new road of advance for developing the overall economy and improving the people’s standard of living. The flames of the campaign to implement the Party’s ideas and defend its policies have unfolded a proud reality of our indigenous plane flying in the sky and our indigenous subway train running under the ground, and rich fish and fruit harvests were gathered, their socialist flavour bringing pleasure to the people. Our sportspeople including the trustworthy women’s soccer players exalted the honour of their motherland and further encouraged the militant spirit of our service personnel and people by winning gold medals in international competitions. Through the large-scale events held to celebrate the Party’s 70th anniversary drawing the attention of the world, we demonstrated far and wide the might of the single-hearted unity of all the service personnel and people around the Party and the bright future of Juche Korea. The moving scenes unfolded on the October celebration square shook the world with power greater than that of explosion of an atomic bomb or that of the launching of an earth satellite, and clearly showed that nothing can check the dynamic advance of our Party, service personnel and people that are fighting with the single-hearted unity and arms as their ever-victorious weapons. Last year our service personnel and people warded off the danger of war facing their country and nation and safeguarded the dignity of the Republic and world peace with honour. That we neutralized the hair-trigger situation teetering on the brink of armed conflict owing to the grave political and military provocations by the hostile forces and defended the dignity and security of our motherland from possible calamities is a brilliant victory born of the Herculean might of the great army-people unity and of the powerful Paektusan revolutionary army. What makes us look back upon last year with greater delight is that our young vanguard who are reliably carrying forward the lineage of the Juche revolution and faith demonstrated the might of the youth power without parallel in the world by means of their loyalty to the Party and heroic struggle. Educated and trained in the embrace of the great leaders and the Party, our young people rushed ahead along the course of the Korean revolution set by the Party, creating the charging spirit and culture of young people of the Songun era and performing laudable deeds that touched people’s heartstrings. The millions of young people, fully equipped with the revolutionary ideology of the great leaders and firmly rallied behind the Party, have grown strong in ideas and faith, to become successors to the cause of the Juche revolution. This is the greatest dignity, pride and success for us. All the victories and successes achieved last year are a fruition born of the heroic struggle of our people, who turned out in the general offensive for their country’s prosperity with the spirit and mettle of Paektu, and a crystallization of the invaluable blood and sweat the service personnel and people dedicated to the country and the revolution. Spending last year seething with creation and filled with miraculous achievements together with the service personnel and people, who were burning their hearts with patriotism and loyalty, our Party witnessed with a warm feeling their beautiful spiritual world and strenuous struggle and gained greater strength and courage from their trust-filled look and sincere opinions. As there are the Party’s sagacious leadership, the invincible army and the great people that absolutely support the Party and defend it unto death, we have no difficulties to be afraid of and can accomplish any great cause without fail-this is the proud conclusion of last year’s struggle. I extend warm thanks to all the members of the Workers’ Party of Korea, service personnel and people who glorified last year with heroic struggle and feats in devoted support of the cause of the Party cherishing ardent loyalty to it and faith in sure victory. Comrades, This year is a significant year when the Seventh Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea is to be held. The congress will proudly review the successes our Party has achieved in the revolution and construction under the wise guidance of the great leaders, and unfold an ambitious blueprint for hastening final victory for our revolution. We should celebrate the Seventh Party Congress as a glorious meeting of victors as it will constitute a historic landmark in carrying out the cause of the Juche revolution. “Let us usher in a golden age in building a thriving nation in this year when the Seventh Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea is to be held!”-this is the militant slogan our Party and people should uphold as they advance. All Party members, service personnel and other people should turn out as one with ardent loyalty to the Party and extraordinary patriotic zeal, and demonstrate the spirit and mettle of Korea that is rushing forward towards final victory racing against time. We should concentrate all our efforts on building an economic giant to bring about a fresh turn in developing the country’s economy and improving the people’s standard of living. In order to achieve breakthroughs for a turning point in building an economic giant the electric-power, coal-mining and metallurgical industries and the rail transport sector should advance dynamically in the vanguard of the general offensive. The problem of electricity should be resolved as an undertaking involving the whole Party and the whole state. The existing power stations should be kept in a good state of maintenance, bolstered up and run at full capacity to ensure maximum output of electric power. The construction of the Tanchon Power Station and other projects for boosting the country’s power-generating capacity should be promoted along with the efforts to ease the strain on electricity supply by making proactive use of natural energy. All sectors and all units should wage a vigorous campaign to economize on electricity and make effective use of it. The sector of coal-mining industry should raise the fierce flames of an upsurge in production to ensure enough supply of coal for the thermal power stations and several sectors of the national economy. The state should take thoroughgoing measures to make certain that the sector of metallurgical industry receives adequate material supplies and the metallurgical factories, such as the Kim Chaek and Hwanghae iron and steel complexes, expand the successes achieved in making their production Juche-based and modern. By doing so it can increase the output of iron and steel. The rail transport sector should establish rigid discipline and increase effectiveness in organizing and controlling transport services to ensure regular operation of trains, and step up the modernization of railways. Our Party maintains the improvement of the people’s living conditions as the most important of the numerous state affairs. The crop farming, animal husbandry and fishing sectors should make innovations to effect a radical change in improving the people’s standard of living. The agricultural sector should actively adopt superior strains and scientific farming methods, speed up the comprehensive mechanization of the rural economy and take strict measures for each farming process, so as to carry out the cereals production plan without fail. The animal husbandry and fishing sectors, which are waging an all-out struggle in response to the Party’s call, should ramp up production as soon as possible and see to it that the fish farms, vegetable greenhouses and mushroom production bases built across the country pay off. Thus they can contribute to enriching the people’s diet. The light industry sector should put its factories and enterprises on a highly modern footing, provide them with plenty of raw and other materials to keep their production going full steam and increase the number of world-famous products and commodities with a competitive edge. Construction is a yardstick and visual evidence for the strength of a country and the quality of its civilization; it constitutes a worthwhile, important undertaking for embodying our Party’s people-oriented policies. The construction sector should launch a general offensive to implement the Party’s construction policy and grand plan. By doing so, it should build important production facilities, educational and cultural institutions and dwelling houses on the highest possible level and at the fastest possible speed, so that they serve as standards and models of the times. In this way it can make sure that the great heyday of construction continues without letup. All the sectors of the national economy should set ambitious goals and maintain regular production by tapping every possible internal reserve and potentiality. They should also take it as an important policy-oriented requirement to improve product quality, ensure domestic production of equipment and rely on locally available raw and other materials, and make strenuous efforts to this end. The whole Party, the entire army and all the people should buckle down to the campaign to restore the forests of the country. The urban and rural areas, workplaces and villages should be kept spick and span, and positive measures should be taken to conserve the resources of the country and prevent air, river and sea pollution. Our Party is steadfast in its determination and will to solidify the foundations of a thriving country by dint of science and technology and, with them as the engine, achieve national prosperity. The scientific research sector should give priority to resolving the scientific and technological problems that arise in consolidating the might of the Juche-based industry, the socialist independent economy, and improving the people’s standard of living, and strive to push back the frontiers of science and technology. Factories, enterprises and cooperative farms should build science and technology diffusion rooms in a splendid fashion and put their operation on a regular basis, so as to ensure that all the working people learn modern science and technology. It is also necessary to establish a social climate of resolving the problems arising in reality on the strength of science and technology. The Cabinet and other state and economic organs should decisively improve their economic planning and guidance. Leading economic officials should fully equip themselves with Party policy, work out plans of the economic work in an innovative way and give a strong push to it on the principle of developing all the sectors at an exponential speed by relying on the inexhaustible creative strength of the working people and by dint of modern science and technology. They should accurately identify the main link in the whole chain of economic development and concentrate efforts on it while revitalizing the overall economy, especially when the conditions are not favourable and many difficulties arise. They should be proactive in organizing and launching the work of establishing on a full scale our style of economic management method which embodies the Juche idea, thus giving full play to its advantages and vitality. The political and military might of our Republic should be strengthened in every way. It is necessary to cement the politico-ideological position of socialism rock-solid. We should regard ideology as the driving force of the revolution and focus on the five-point education so as to train all the service personnel and people to be strong in ideas, to etch in their hearts the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu, and encourage them to give free rein to their indomitable mental strength in the struggle to carry out the instructions of the great leaders and safeguard the Party’s policies. Political work and frontline-style information and motivational work should be vigorously conducted to ensure that the whole country seethes with an atmosphere of heightened political enthusiasm in the lead-up to the Seventh Party Congress. Single-hearted unity is the great foundation and ever-victorious weapon for the Juche revolution. All the officials, Party members and other working people should connect their burning hearts with the garden of the offices of the Party Central Committee and share the Party’s ideas, breathe the same breath as it and keep pace with it in order to travel one road forever following the Party. Party organizations and state organs should give absolute priority to the demands and interests of the people by thoroughly applying the politics of prioritizing, respecting and loving them, and take responsible care of their political integrity and material and cultural life to the end. Party organizations should take hold of public sentiments, rally the broad sections of the masses closely around the Party, and launch an intensive struggle among officials against all practices of abuse of power, bureaucratism and corruption that gnaw at and undermine our single-hearted unity. The country’s defence capability should be built up. In this year, which marks the 20th anniversary of the movement of winning the title of O Jung Hup-led 7th Regiment initiated by General Kim Jong Il, the People’s Army should further develop itself into a revolutionary army of the Party in which the Party’s unified command system is thoroughly established, into a steadfast army of the Party that keeps the revolutionary faith to the death, and effect a turnaround in implementing the Party’s four-point line of building up the army to be formidable. By keeping it as the seed to conduct training in a real-war atmosphere and put it on a scientific and modern footing, the army should raise the fierce flames of training so that all the service personnel are prepared to be elite soldiers of modern warfare and stout fighters who are equipped with the military strategies and tactics of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the heroic fighting spirit and flawless abilities to fight an actual war. It should become a standard-bearer and shock force of the times to make breakthroughs as intended by the Party on the major fronts where a thriving country is being built, and look for more tasks that are for the good of the people. Officers and men of the Korean People’s Internal Security Forces should smash in embryo the manoeuvrings of the class enemy and hostile elements to harm the leadership of the revolution, our socialist system and our people’s lives and property, and members of the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and the Young Red Guards should intensify combat and political training and fully prepare themselves to defend their villages. The munitions industry sector should develop defence science and technology, put the defence industry on a highly Juche-oriented, modern and scientific footing, and give full play to the revolutionary spirit of Kunja-ri, so as to develop and produce a greater number of various means of military strike of our own style that are capable of overwhelming the enemy. We should ensure that our people enjoy the highest quality of civilization on the highest level. By raising the flames of radical improvement in education in the new century, we should renovate the conditions and environment for education and improve its quality decisively, thereby bringing up talented personnel who are knowledgeable, morally sound and physically strong. We should improve medical treatment and preventive work as required by the socialist public health system in order to protect the people’s life and promote their health. We should make sports mass-based and part of daily concern to ensure that the whole country is astir with enthusiasm for sports, and radically develop the specialized sporting techniques to create new miracles of heroic Korea in international games. The sector of art and literature should brace itself to produce a larger number of contemporary masterpieces which make all the service personnel and people burn their hearts with enthusiasm for the revolution and for struggle. We should launch a strong drive to establish discipline with regard to moral ethics so as to ensure that a sound and civilized way of life prevails throughout the country. All the officials and working people should turn out as one in the struggle to usher in a golden age in building a thriving nation in this year when the Seventh Party Congress is to be held. It is the tradition of struggle and temperament of our people to turn out with a single mind and will and continuously work miracles like moving mountains and filling up seas if it is the Party’s call. The heroic working class of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, as befits the core unit of the Juche revolution and the eldest son of the country, should support the Party’s ideas and cause in the vanguard and advance holding up the torch of a new great revolutionary upsurge in building an economic giant. Agricultural workers, with the sense of responsibility that they are in the trench on the first line of the forward echelon of the campaign to defend socialism, should strive to bring about a turn in agricultural production. Intellectuals should promote the building of a thriving country by means of brilliant scientific and technological successes as required by the era of the knowledge-based economy, and become pacesetters and standard-bearers in opening the efflorescence of civilization of the age of the Workers’ Party. Our Party pins a great hope on the role of young people in today’s general advance. Young people, cherishing the trust of the Party that has given prominence to them as masters of the youth power, should train themselves further to be dependable pillars of the country and become artists of miracles and heroes on all the sites where a thriving nation is being built. Officials should immerse themselves in the reality to inspire the masses and conduct every undertaking in a revolutionary and scientific way. They should also become true servants of the people and competent leading personnel of the revolution who make selfless, devoted efforts for the good of the people with the ennobling view of life that they have nothing more to wish for even though their bodies may be scattered like the grains of sand on the road for the good of the people. In all fields of social life we should sustain the original features and great appearances of our society which is advancing on the strength of helping and leading one another forward and through a concerted effort. Our target is a Juche-oriented socialist power, and the might of socialism is none other than the might of collectivism. All sectors and all units should attach primary importance to the interests of the state, the Party and the revolution, introduce the successes and experiences gained by the leading units and make leaps and bounds in the flames of collectivist competition. The principle of giving priority to self-development should be maintained in building a thriving socialist country. Worship of big countries and dependence on foreign forces is the road to national ruin; self-development alone is the road to sustaining the dignity of our country and our nation and to paving a broad avenue for the revolution and construction. With affection, trust, dignity and pride in everything of our own, we should achieve the great cause of building a thriving nation and realize the people’s beautiful dreams and ideals without fail by our own efforts, technology and resources. National reunification is the most pressing and vital task facing the nation. Last year, greeting the 70th anniversary of national liberation, we appealed to all the compatriots to pool their efforts to open up a broad avenue to independent reunification, and strived for its realization. However, the anti-reunification forces that are not desirous of national reunification and improved inter-Korean relations ran amuck to realize their schemes for a war and even created a touch-and-go situation short of crossfire, causing grave apprehension at home and abroad. The south Korean authorities publicly sought to realize their goal of “regime change” in our country and unilateral “unification of systems” against the trend of inter-Korean dialogue and detente, and fanned distrust and confrontation between the north and the south. This year we should hold up the slogan “Let us frustrate the challenges by the anti-reunification forces within and without and usher in a new era of independent reunification!” and press on with the national reunification movement more vigorously. We should reject foreign intervention and resolve the issues of inter-Korean relations and national reunification independently in keeping with the aspirations and demands of the nation. It is none other than the outside forces that divided our nation, and it is also none other than the United States and its followers that obstruct the reunification of our country. Notwithstanding this, the south Korean authorities are clinging to a smear campaign against the fellow countrymen in collusion with the outside forces while touring foreign countries to ask for the solution of the internal issue of our nation, the issue of its reunification. This is a betrayal of the country and nation that leaves the destiny of the nation at the mercy of the outside forces and sells out its interests. The issues of inter-Korean relations and national reunification should, to all intents and purposes, be resolved by the efforts of our nation in conformity with its independent will and demands, true to the principle of By Our Nation Itself. No one will or can bring our nation reunification. The whole nation should struggle resolutely against the sycophantic and treacherous manoeuvres of the anti-reunification forces to cooperate with the outside forces. The south Korean authorities should discontinue such a humiliating act as going on a tour of foreign countries touting for cooperation in resolving the internal issues of the nation. It is fundamental to realizing the country’s reunification to prevent the danger of war and safeguard peace and security in the Korean peninsula. Today the peninsula has become the hottest spot in the world and a hotbed of nuclear war owing to the U.S. aggressive strategy for the domination of Asia and its reckless moves for a war against the DPRK. The U.S. and south Korean war maniacs are conducting large-scale military exercises aimed at a nuclear war against the DPRK one after another every year; this is precipitating a critical situation in the Korean peninsula and throwing serious obstacles in the way of improving inter-Korean relations. Last year’s August emergency showed that even a trifling, incidental conflict between the north and the south may spark a war and escalate into an all-out war. The U.S. and south Korean authorities must discontinue their extremely dangerous aggressive war exercises and suspend acts of military provocation that aggravates tension in the Korean peninsula. It is our consistent stand to strive with patience for peace in the peninsula and security in the region. However, if aggressors dare to provoke us, though to a slight degree, we will never tolerate it but respond resolutely with a merciless sacred war of justice, a great war for national reunification. We should value such agreements common to the nation as the three principles for national reunification and declarations between the north and the south, and in conformity with them, open up an avenue to improved bilateral relations. These principles and declarations constitute the great reunification programme common to the nation, and all fellow countrymen wish that they are implemented as soon as possible and a radical phase opened up in reunifying the country. If they are sincere about improving inter-Korean relations and reunifying the country peacefully, the south Korean authorities must not seek pointless confrontation of systems, but make it clear that they intend to respect and implement with sincerity the three principles for national reunification, June 15 Joint Declaration and October 4 Declaration, which crystallize the general will of the nation and whose validity has been proved in practice. They should cherish the spirit of the agreement signed last year at the inter-Korean high-level emergency contact, and desist from any act that will lead to a breach of the agreement and mar the atmosphere of dialogue. In the future, too, we will make strenuous efforts to develop inter-Korean talks and improve bilateral relations. We will also have an open-minded discussion on the reunification issue, one of the national issues, with anyone who is truly desirous of national reconciliation and unity, peace and reunification. All the Korean people in the north, in the south and abroad will smash all challenges and obstructive moves by the anti-reunification forces in and out of the country and build a dignified and prosperous reunified Korea on this land without fail under the banner of By Our Nation Itself. The United States has persisted in ignoring our just demand for replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace pact to remove the danger of war, ease tension and create a peaceful environment in the Korean peninsula. Instead, it has clung to its anachronistic policy hostile towards the DPRK, escalating the tension and egging its vassal forces on to stage a “human rights” racket against the country. However, no plots and schemes of the enemy could break the indomitable will of our service personnel and people to firmly defend and add brilliance to our style of people-centred socialism, the base of their happy life. The challenges by the hostile forces remain uninterrupted and the situation is as tense as ever, but we will invariably advance along the road of independence, Songun and socialism under the unfurled red flag of the revolution, and make all responsible efforts to safeguard peace and security in the Korean peninsula and the rest of the world. Our Party and the government of our Republic will further strengthen solidarity with the peoples of the world who are opposed to aggression and war, domination and subordination, and develop relations of friendship and cooperation with all the countries that respect our national sovereignty and are friendly to us. The cause of Juche-oriented socialism is ever-victorious, and only victory and glory is in store for us who are advancing under the leadership of the Workers’ Party of Korea. Let us all strive for the final victory of the revolution full of confidence in victory and optimism.

09.05.2016,Kim Jong-un,"Dear delegates, Today we are holding the historic Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea amid the grand struggle in which the whole Party, the entire army and all the people, filled with iron 1 nerves and confidence to achieve the final victory of the Juche revolution as soon as possible, are making an all-out, general onward march courageously, thwarting all manner of threats and desperate challenges by the imperialists. Reflecting the infinite loyalty and ardent reverence of delegates, Party members, service personnel and all other people across the country, I would like first to extend the noblest tribute and greatest glory to the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il who are the founder and builder of the WPK, incarnations of the mightiness of the invincible WPK, and eternal leaders of our Party and people. Comrades, During the period under review our Party and people have waged a sacred yet arduous struggle to defend socialism and propel the cause of the Juche revolution victoriously under the wise leadership of the great President Kim Il Sung and General Kim Jong Il. In this period our Party's ranks have been deprived of such anti-Japanese revolutionary war veterans as Kim Il, Choe Hyon, O Paek Ryong, O Jin U, Choe Kwang, Rim Chun Chu, Pak Song Chol, Jon Mun Sop and Ri Ul Sol, who, holding the great leaders in high esteem, devoted themselves entirely to the country and people on the long road of the Juche revolution. And they have been bereft of many faithful revolutionary comrades, including Ho Tam, Yon Hyong Muk, Kim Jung Rin, Ho Jong Suk, Kim Kuk Thae, Kim Yong Sun, Kim Yang Gon, Jon Pyong Ho, Pak Song Bong, Ri Chan Son, Ri Je Gang, Ri Yong Chol, Kang Ryang Uk, Ri Jong Ok, Kim Rak Hui and An Tal Su, who worked with devotion for the strengthening and development of our Party and the victory of the socialist cause. We have also lost Jo Myong Rok, Kim Kwang Jin, Kim Tu Nam, Jon Jae Son, Yun Chi Ho, Ri Tong Chun, Kim Ha Gyu, Ri Jin Su, Sim Chang Wan and other precious comrades-in-arms in the Songun revolution who performed heroic exploits in the struggle to strengthen and develop the revolutionary armed forces. In addition, Ri Sung Gi, Im Rok Jae, Chon Se Bong, Paek In Jun, Yu Won Jun, Ri Sang Byok, Pak Yong Sun and other academicians, professors, doctors, writers, People's Artistes and People's Athletes, who bent all their energies and wisdom to developing science, culture and the arts, and sports, and Han Tok Su, Choe Tok Sin, Ri In Mo, Rim Hon Sik, Kim Kwang Thaek and other unforgettable revolutionary comrades and pro-reunification, patriotic figures passed away. These people devoted their all unsparingly to the victory of the cause of the Juche revolution, 2 reunification of the country and national prosperity, in loyal support of the WPK and the leader; the brilliant victory of our revolution and the present glory of the socialist country are attributable to their priceless blood and self-sacrifice. To the memory of the anti-Japanese revolutionary war veterans, patriotic martyrs, unforgettable revolutionary comrades-in-arms of our Party and pro-reunification, patriotic figures who laid down their precious lives in the struggle for socialist construction, national reunification and the cause of global independence, I propose to observe a minute's silence. Comrades, The Seventh Congress of the WPK has been convened at a historic time when the phase of leap forward in implementing the cause of the Juche revolution is being opened up. The last decades since the Sixth Congress of the WPK were characterized by grim struggle and glorious victory on the part of our Party and people. During the period under review the situation of our revolution was very grave and complex. In the unprecedentedly hard times when the world socialist system collapsed and the allied imperialist forces concentrated their anti-socialist offensive on our Republic, our Party and people were compelled to fight against them single-handed. The imperialists strained the situation constantly for decades to keep our people from living at peace even for a moment and blocked all the pathways to economic development and existence through all manner of blockade, pressure and sanctions. In the face of harsh and manifold difficulties and ordeals and the hardships and sufferings worse than those during a war, our Party and people were united more firmly around the Central Committee of the WPK, holding the President and the General in high esteem as the centre of unity and leadership, and made strenuous efforts to defend and advance the socialist cause, following only the revolutionary line of Juche put forward by the great leaders as they braved the storm of history without the slightest hesitation or vacillation. As there were the wise leadership of the President and the General and the might of singlehearted unity of the WPK, the army and the people around the leader, we were able to etch proud victories in history, smashing the schemes of the allied imperialist forces to stifle the Republic at every step and safeguarding the red flag of socialism and the gains of the revolution to the last. 3 During the period under review, the WPK embodied the Juche-oriented line of party building of General Kim Jong Il to become a powerful body, ideologically pure and organizationally integrated, in which oneness has been achieved in ideology and leadership and to develop into a motherly party assuming the responsibility for the destiny of the masses of the people, an ever-victorious party with seasoned and sophisticated art of leadership and a steel-strong and promising revolutionary party. This year when the Seventh Congress of the WPK is held, our service personnel and people achieved great successes in the first hydrogen bomb test and the launch of earth observation satellite Kwangmyongsong 4 which served as landmarks in the nation's history spanning 5,000 years, thus raising the dignity and might of Juche Korea to the highest level possible; in high spirits, they conducted a dynamic 70-day campaign of loyalty to perform great feats and make unprecedented labour successes in all fields of socialist construction. All the service personnel and people throughout the country displayed the spirit of carrying out the policies of the WPK to the death in response to its militant call for launching the 70-day campaign, thereby making the greatest successes and leap forward in all sectors of the national economy and achieving the brilliant result of exceeding the targets of the campaign set by the WPK. During the campaign, the electric-power, coal-mining and metallurgical industries and rail transport sector strove hard for increased output and transport to bring about a surge in production, and many units in different sectors of the national economy including the machinebuilding, chemical, building-materials and light industries and agriculture raised a strong wind to ensure modernization and domestic production of our style and bring about an upswing in production, thus making the distinguished achievement of carrying out the first half-year and yearly national economic plans ahead of schedule. Our heroic working class of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, scientists and technicians waged an unyielding struggle on the principle of giving priority to self-development to develop and manufacture new machines and equipment based on local efforts and technology, thereby presenting them as gifts to the Congress of the motherly Party. Others across the country wonderfully completed lots of major construction projects, which will be highly conducive to developing the economy and improving the people's living standards, in a short span of time before the Congress to send reports of loyalty to the Central Committee of the WPK. Those in the national defence science sector that played a magnificent prelude to this meaningful year with a thrilling explosion of Juche Korea's first hydrogen bomb went on to 4 create momentous miracles in defending our national dignity and sovereignty, thus topping off the 70-day campaign and opening wide the door to the Seventh Congress of the WPK, full of pride in being victors. All sectors and all units, burning their hearts with ardent loyalty to the WPK and extraordinary patriotic enthusiasm, sped up the grand revolutionary march to celebrate the Seventh Congress of the WPK as a glorious meeting of victors. This fully demonstrated the firm faith and will of our service personnel and people who are triumphantly building a thriving nation before the eyes of the world by smashing the hostile forces' vicious manoeuvres geared to sanctions and strangulation, and displayed to the world the indomitable spirit, daring grit and inexhaustible strength of heroic Korea. The numerous eye-opening events that happened one after another in the run-up to the meaningful Congress of the WPK–all these achievements are permeated with the precious sweat, ardent passion and unassuming effort of the Party members who have always thrown in their lot with the WPK and adorned the golden age of socialist construction with uninterrupted revolutionary upsurges. I would like to extend heartfelt thanks and militant greetings, on behalf of the Central Committee of the WPK, to all the delegates, Party members, service personnel of the Korean People's Army and other people, who have adorned the sacred history of the WPK with hot blood and sweat of patriotism and made a great contribution to celebrating the Seventh Congress of the WPK as a meeting of victory and glory by clasping the weapons of revolution, hammer, sickle and writing brush with a burning conviction to travel one road for ever following our Party. On the occasion of our Party's significant Congress my warm greetings go to the Anti-imperialist National Democratic Front, Korean Social Democratic Party, Chondoist Chongu Party, south Korean people, Chongryon (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan) and other overseas Koreans' organizations and all the compatriots abroad that are working hard for the country's reunification and prosperity. On behalf of the Congress of the WPK, I also extend warm thanks and greetings to political parties and organizations, Juche idea study groups, friendship and solidarity organizations and personages from all walks of life in different countries of the world and representatives of diplomatic missions and international organizations in the DPRK, that have rendered positive support and encouragement to our revolution and sent congratulatory messages, letters and baskets of flowers to the Seventh Congress of the WPK. 5 Comrades, The Seventh Congress of the WPK will sum up the brilliant successes and invaluable experience our Party and people have gained during the period under review and put forward the strategic line and tasks to keep ushering in a great golden age of socialist construction and the direction of advance of our revolution. TAfter setting it as the strategic line to put the national economy on Juche, modern and scientific basis, the WPK has organized and mobilized all the people in the struggle for implementing it and thus brought about a gigantic advance in attaining the ten-point long-term goal of socialist economic construction. The WPK has waged a courageous struggle to defend and advance the socialist cause with the firm will to shatter the imperialists' counter-revolutionary offensive with the revolutionary one. At a time when the socialist cause was advancing victoriously along the orbit of Juche under the rapidly changing situation and a bright prospect was opening up for national reunification, our party and people suffered the greatest sudden loss to the nation, the demise of President Kim Il Sung whom they trusted and followed like Heaven. It was a bolt from the blue. The demise of Kim Il Sung was the biggest grief and loss to our party and people and the biggest trial for our revolution. After the greatest loss to the nation, the imperialists and their followers have reached the height in their political and military pressure, moves for provoking a war and economic blockade. To cap it all, the country was hit by severe natural disasters, bringing untold hardships and trial to the economic construction and people's living. When the world was concerned about the fate of the DPRK and when the imperialist reactionaries were foolishly trumpeting about ""change in line"" and ""collapse of social system"", leader Kim Jong Il solemnly declared his iron will to invariably defend and carry to completion 7 the revolutionary cause of Juche started by the President no matter how arduous the road of the revolution might be, and wisely led the revolution and construction only as intended by the President and the way he did. By carrying forward the cause of the President under the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il, the WPK has firmly maintained the Songun revolutionary line, the path of winning the steady victory of the Korean revolution, and enforced the Songun politics in an all-round way. The WPK has bolstered up the People's Army in every way, established state machinery centered on the national defence and transformed and adjusted all fields on the principle of Songun as required by it. Thanks to the heroic struggle of the service personnel and other people who turned out as one in close unity around the party, the DPRK won victory after victory in the protracted fierce confrontation with the imperialists and the U.S., victoriously concluded the Arduous March, the forced march and honorably safeguarded the security and the sovereignty of the country and socialism. In the grim struggle for defending socialism, the WPK set forth the high goal of building a powerful socialist nation and waged a strenuous struggle, thus advancing the socialist cause onto a new higher stage. At a time when historic changes were taking place in accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche and Korean-style socialism was dynamically advancing along the road of victory indicated by the Songun politics, our party and people suffered all of a sudden another greatest loss to the nation-- the demise of Kim Jong Il. All the party members, service personnel and other people seized with the profound grief over the loss of Kim Jong Il, overcame sorrow with strength and courage as befitting his soldiers and disciples and courageously turned out in the struggle to translate into a brilliant reality his lifetime plan and desire in close unity around the Party Central Committee. At the 4th Conference of the WPK, it clarified the revolutionary faith and will to hold Kim Il Sungand Kim Jong Il as eternal leaders of our party and the revolution and to uphold the great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism as the eternal guiding idea, and aroused all the party members and other people to the drive for implementing the last instructions of the leaders. As required by the prevailing situation and the developing revolution, the WPK advanced the strategic line of simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of 8 nuclear force and worked hard for its implementation. Thanks to the dynamic struggle waged by the army and people of the DPRK to carry out the strategic line of the party, a sure guarantee was provided for finally concluding the confrontation with the imperialists and the U.S. and accelerating the final victory of our cause. The WPK organized and waged an all-people general onward movement for building a thriving people's paradise as planned and desired by the great leaders and thus ushered in the new era of the prosperity of the country. The entire party and all the people have achieved the single-minded unity of the whole society in which they are united closely around the leader in thinking and purpose and sense of moral obligation. This is the great success and feat achieved by our party during the period under review. Regarding it as its strategic line to attach importance to youth throughout the period of leading the revolution, the WPK has trained the young people as successors to the revolution who carry forward the blood line of Juche, thus building the youth power without an equal in the world. A spectacular success made by the WPK is that it has implemented the Songun revolutionary line, the military line of self-defence, thus turning the country into an invincible military power. Our party and people dynamically waged the drive to implement the strategic line of socialist economic construction to lay firm material and technical foundations of self-supporting national economy and provide a springboard from which to build an economic giant. The WPK has successfully settled the theoretical and practical matters arising in carrying forward the revolutionary cause and faithfully inherited and developed the idea and cause of the leaders. Kim Jong Un indicated the tasks and ways for developing the Korean revolution on a higher stage and accomplishing the cause of socialism by regarding the idea and exploits of the great leaders as an eternal cornerstone. He went on: It is necessary to model the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism in order to accomplish the socialist cause and completely achieve the independence of the popular masses. In the crucible of the nationwide struggle for the great unity of the nation the Pan-national Alliance for Korea's Reunification was formed comprising broad patriotic forces in the north and the south and abroad, reunification events took place one after another to demonstrate the wisdom of the nation and the movement for national reunification further developed into a nationwide one. The noble patriotic will for reunification of Kim Jong Il and his bold decision resulted in two rounds of north-south summit and the adoption of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, its action programme, guided by the idea of By Our Nation Itself, the first of their kind in the history of national division. This was an epochal event that provided a historic milestone for independent reunification and opened up a turning phase for national reunification. Thanks to the wise guidance of the great leaders, the cause of national reunification could advance along the orbit of national independence for decades despite the complicated situation where the separatist forces at home and abroad got all the more frantic in their moves, and the driving force of national reunification could steadily grow stronger to prevail over the anti-reunification forces. 10 We should consistently keep a firm hold on the three charters for national reunification which comprehensively deal with the will and requirements of all the Koreans and whose vitality was proved in practice and should pave the road for reunification. Noting that in the period under review, the DPRK's relationship with other countries has developed despite of the persistent hostile policy of the U.S. and its followers and their intensified moves for isolating and stifling it, Kim Jong Un set forth the tasks for the victory in the cause of global independence. Independence, peace and friendship are the invariable foreign policy tenet of the WPK and the principled stand to be maintained in the efforts for accomplishing the cause of global independence. It is our Party's goal to build a peaceful world free from war and it is the constant stand of our Party and the DPRK government to struggle for regional and global peace and security. As a responsible nuclear weapons state, our Republic will not use a nuclear weapon unless its sovereignty is encroached upon by any aggressive hostile forces with nukes, as it had already declared, and it will faithfully fulfill its obligation for non-proliferation and strive for the global denuclearization. The WPK and the DPRK government will improve and normalize the relations with those countries which respect the sovereignty of the DPRK and are friendly towards it, though they had been hostile toward it in the past. Kim Jong Un noted that the WPK has developed into the great and dignified KimilsungistKimjongilist Party, opening up a new path in the building of a revolutionary party, and led the revolutionary cause of Juche along the road of shining victory. The WPK should be strengthened into the eternal Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Party and its leadership role be steadily enhanced to successfully carry out the important tasks for accomplishing the socialist cause, the revolutionary cause of Juche under the banner of modeling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism, he stressed. He called for rallying closer around the Party Central Committee under the revolutionary banner of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and dynamically advancing toward the strengthening of the Party, the accomplishment of the socialist cause, the independent reunification of the country and the realization of the cause of global independence. It has laid a solid organizational and ideological basis and leadership system capable of carrying forward the cause of the leader generation after generation and thus inherited the idea and guidance of the leader for decades without slight turns and twists and deviation and firmly preserved the revolutionary character of the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist party. It has channeled big efforts into settling the youth issue directly linked with the prospect of the party and firmly prepared the young people to be reliable reserves of the party. Kim Jong Un referred to the fact that the WPK has developed into the invincible party with the 12 solid mass foundation and powerful military foundation. He continued: The WPK has developed into the revolutionary party and the motherly party which is deeply rooted among the popular masses and which formed a harmonious whole with the people in intention and feelings. It has trained the People's Army as a matchless revolutionary army of the Party remaining boundlessly loyal to it and let the People's Army become a strong pillar of the Party and thereby enabled it to perform a militant function and role as the powerful general staff of the Songun revolution. It has struggled, regarding it as an iron rule to settle all issues arising in the revolution and construction by relying on the popular masses. Kim Jong Un said it is the general task of the party building to strengthen the WPK into the party of the great leader. He went on: We should uphold great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism as the guiding idea of the Party and revolution forever and firmly defend and glorify the undying leadership feats of the great leaders eternally. It is necessary to advance the revolution and construction with Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism as the only guidelines and conduct the party building and activities as required by it from A to Z. We should strictly establish the revolutionary discipline and order whereby the entire party membership acts as one under the monolithic leadership of the Party Central Committee. It is necessary to firmly build up the party and revolutionary ranks and augment their militant might in every way. We should strictly adhere to the principle of the system of unitary management in the ideological work. We should thoroughly apply the popular masses-first principle in the overall party work. ""Let the Whole Party Make Selfless, Devoted Service for the Good of the Great People!"" This is the fighting slogan to be held up by the Party at present. We should steadily enhance the leadership role of the Party in the revolutionary struggle and 13 construction work. It is necessary to do away with the old pattern in the party work method and apply the work method of Kim Jong Il's style in an overall way. Kim Jong Un called for steadily developing the WPK into the party of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and enhancing the leadership role of the Party in every way and thereby bringing about a new turn in the historic struggle for modeling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. Kim Jong Un Reviews Successes Made by WPK in Period under Review Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The respected Comrade Kim Jong Un in a report on the review of the work of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) at its 7th Congress said that the period since the 6th Congress of the WPK was the one of the unprecedentedly grim struggle in its long history and years of glorious victory which witnessed great changes. In the period under review, the WPK set forth the Juche-oriented line and policy in every stage of the development of revolution amid the unprecedented serious atmosphere and dynamically advanced the revolution and construction by relying on the people and thus achieved the brilliant victory in accomplishing the cause of socialism and ushered in a fresh era of the country's prosperity, he said, and went on: The WPK organized and aroused all party members and other people to accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche, holding fast to the banner of the great Juche idea and the Songun revolutionary line. The WPK has worked hard to advance the socialist cause under the unprecedented trials and difficulties. Under the grim situation, the WPK firmly adhered to the independent stand against imperialism and the socialist principle relying on the might of arms under the uplifted banner of Songun and thus led with confidence our revolution to victory. As required by the prevailing situation and the developing revolution, the WPK advanced the strategic line of simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force and worked hard for its implementation. Thanks to the dynamic struggle waged by the army and people of the DPRK to carry out the 14 strategic line of the party, a sure guarantee was provided for victoriously concluding the confrontation against imperialism and the U.S. and accelerating the final victory of our cause. Kim Jong Un said that in the period under the review shining victory was made in the socialist construction and an eternal foundation for the prosperity of the country was provided. He went on: The WPK built the political and ideological power and invincible military power in which all the people are united in single mind. By giving definite precedence to ideological education and political work with main stress consistently placed on ideology, our party brought up all the party members and other people to be steadfast revolutionary fighters who enshrined the firm faith that our party and system, our idea and cause are the best. Regarding it as its strategic line to attach importance to youth throughout the period of leading the revolution, the WPK has trained the young people as successors to the revolution who carry forward the blood line of Juche, thus building the youth power without an equal in the world. A spectacular success made by the WPK is that it has implemented the Songun revolutionary line, the military line of self-defence, thus turning the country into an invincible military power. A great world-startling development has been achieved in the fields of national defence industry and national defence science and technology. The climate of attaching importance to the army and military affairs has been created throughout the society and a turn effected in rounding off the combat preparations of the militia forces. A big stride has been made in the economic and cultural construction. Raw materials, fuel and power bases of the self-supporting economy have been reinforced and Juche-based production processes introduced into core fields and the structure of industrial sectors further improved. A successful innovation was witnessed in the development of communications service and production processes, technical equipment and operation means have been further modernized in various fields including transport and building-materials industry. 15 A high-pitched campaign for bringing about a radical turn in seed selection, potato farming, double cropping and scientific farming was waged in the field of agriculture to provide a guarantee for increasing grain production. Modern stock-breeding bases, fish farms, vegetable greenhouses, mushroom farms and vast thriving orchards were built across the country. In fisheries a campaign for carrying out the Party's idea of creating a new history of sea of gold has been waged to make a breakthrough in the development of the fishing industry. Technical updating and the work for ensuring the local supply of raw and other materials has been positively conducted in factories and enterprises in the field of light industry to ensure increased production and supply of quality consumer goods for people. Many monumental edifices representing the era of the Workers' Party to which the Jucheoriented architectural idea was applied were built to lay a solid foundation for socialist economic construction and improvement of the people's living standards. Able scientists and technicians grew in number while the material and technical foundation for the scientific researches was consolidated despite economic hardship, bringing about radical development of the science and technology. Fresh progress was made in the education as required by the IT era with the enforcement of the universal 12-year compulsory education and the establishment of the remote education system. The Breast Tumor Institute of the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital, the Okryu Children's Hospital, the Ryugyong Dental Hospital and other modern medical institutions were built and the national telemedicine network was set up to improve the medical care of the people. Hot wind of sports surged across the country and sports facilities were remodeled to bring about a new turn in the sports development. In the period under review an example of Songun culture was set by the Korean People's Army while the State Merited Chorus, pride of our country, and many other art troupes discharged their role as a bugler sounding the revolutionary advance. Multi-part film ""The Nation and Destiny"" and the grand gymnastic and artistic performance ""Arirang"" were acknowledged as the successful pieces of Juche-oriented literature and arts and the world-class masterpieces, and the brisk mass-based cultural and performing activities by the servicepersons and working 16 people made the revolutionary optimism pervade whole society. The drive for turning cities, rural areas, streets and villages into socialist fairyland was waged and various scenic spots and bases for cultural and emotional life were successfully spruced up to improve the conditions and environment for cultural life of the people.. Kim Jong Un stressed that the master key to all victories and successes achieved by the party and people in carrying out the revolutionary cause of Juche in the period under review lies in having struggled under the wise guidance of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, holding them in high esteem as leaders, and successfully carried forward their revolutionary cause generation after generation. The WPK has faithfully carried forward and developed the ideas and cause of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, holding them in high esteem as eternal leaders of our party and revolution on the basis of the unshakable revolutionary faith and sense of moral obligation, he said. He stressed that the WPK which has traversed the victorious road over the past several decades is the dignified and glorious party blessed with the illustrious leaders and is always sure to triumph as it successfully carries forward their ideas and leadership. Kim Jong Un Calls for Global Independence Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The respected Comrade Kim Jong Un, in his report on the review of the work of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) at its 7th Congress, clarified that the WPK would work hard for the victorious cause of global independence. He noted that in the period under review, a radical change was made in the world political structure and correlation of forces and the international circumstances of the Korean revolution remained very complicated. He said: The WPK has fully displayed the dignity of the country through principled and active external activities even under the grave circumstances and complicated international situation and consolidated the international position and influence of the DPRK. It is the common desire of humankind and a historic task of the times to realize the global independence. Since it retained the status of a full-fledged independent power, a nuclear power, the DPRK will develop its external relations in conformity with the status. It is important to adhere to the revolutionary principle and the independent standpoint. Our Party and the DPRK government will wage a vigorous struggle to radically put an end to the danger of nuclear war, imposed by the U.S., with powerful nuclear deterrence and defend the regional and global peace. As a responsible nuclear weapons state, our Republic will not use a nuclear weapon unless its sovereignty is encroached upon by any aggressive hostile forces with nukes, as it had already declared, and it will faithfully fulfill its obligation for non-proliferation and strive for the global denuclearization. With great magnanimity, we will unite and cooperate with any country and nation aspiring after independence and justice, irrespective of differences in ideology and social system. We will improve and normalize the relations with those which respect the sovereignty of the DPRK and are friendly towards it, though they had been hostile toward it in the past The WPK will as ever get closely united with all countries and peoples defending independence and vigorously struggle for the victory in the cause of global independence under the uplifted banner of socialism, the banner of independence against imperialism, Kim Jong Un declared. Kim Jong Un on WPK's Tasks for National Reunification Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- In his report on the review of the work of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) at its 7th Congress, the respected Comrade Kim Jong Unstressed that to achieve the reunification of Korea is an important and urgent task facing the WPK responsible for the destiny of the country and the nation. Recalling that the WPK has made positive efforts to achieve the reunification of the country, the cherished desire of the entire Korean nation, in the period under review, he said: It is the steadfast resolve and will of the WPK to achieve the independent reunification of the 19 country at any cost. We should pave the road for reunification, consistently keeping a firm hold on the three charters for national reunification which comprehensively deal with the will and requirements of all Koreans and whose vitality was proven in practice. National independence and great national unity should be achieved and peace and federal formula ensured. The north and the south should positively develop the dialogue and negotiations at all levels in various fields to remove each other's misunderstanding and distrust and jointly pave the way for national reunification and prosperity common to the nation. In order to improve the north-south relations and pave the wide avenue to the national reunification, the agreements common to the nation should be respected and consistently implemented. And it should not instigate the south Korean authorities to confrontation with their fellow countrymen but 20 hand off the Korean Peninsula issue. Japan should discard its greed for reinvasion of the Korean Peninsula and repent and apologize for the past crimes it committed against the Korean nation. And it should not hinder the reunification of Korea. Those countries surrounding the Korean Peninsula should respect the sovereignty of the DPRK, and they will have to play a positive role in settling the issue of Korea's reunification in an independent and peaceful way to meet the demand and will of the Korean nation. Kim Jong Un declared that the WPK would fully discharge its noble mission and responsibility in improving the north-south relations and hastening the independent reunification of the country in keeping with the demand and interests of the entire nation. Kim Jong Un Sets Forth Tasks for Completing Socialist Cause Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The respected Comrade Kim Jong Un in a report on the review of the work of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) at its 7th Congress set forth the tasks for completing the socialist cause. Kim Jong Un underlined the need to advance the Korean revolution on a higher stage and accomplish the cause of socialism by regarding the idea and exploits of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il as an eternal cornerstone. He went on: In order to accomplish the socialist cause and achieve the complete independence of the popular masses, it is necessary to model the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. We should dynamically wage the struggle for modeling the whole society on KimilsungismKimjongilism to carry through the behests of the great leaders in all fields and develop the party, state and army into Kim Il Sung's and Kim Jong Il's ones forever. In order to successfully build a socialist power under the banner of modeling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism, it is necessary to strengthen the people's government and enhance its function and role and, at the same time, thoroughly carry out the general line of our party on dynamically conducting the three revolutions--ideological, technical and cultural. A scientific and technological power is the major target to be attained by us at present before anything else to build a thriving socialist nation. 21 We should conduct the state unified guidance and strategic management of the economic work in a responsible manner. We should usher in an overall efflorescence in the socialist literature and arts. It is necessary to shatter the imperialist ideological and cultural poisoning and strictly preserve our socialist culture and lifestyle. We should establish strong moral discipline throughout the society. It is necessary to further increase the might of the politico-ideological power and military power. We should more firmly cement the harmonious whole of the party and the popular masses. We should detect and shatter all moves of the enemies to destabilize our socialism in good time and firmly defend our ideology and social system, class position and single-minded unity. 22 The officers and men of the People's Army should become genuine revolutionary comrades and comrades-in-arms always sharing idea, intention and destiny with the Party Central Committee and become manifold human fortress and shield to devotedly defend it in face of any trial and adversity. The People's Army should keep itself highly alerted to cope with the reckless war moves of the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean belligerent forces against the DPRK, and mercilessly punish the aggressors and achieve the historic cause of national reunification if they ignite a war. The Korean People's Internal Security Forces should further sharpen the sword for defending the leader, social system and people. We should direct big efforts to developing the defence industry. We should establish the trait of attaching importance to military affairs in the whole society and make preparations for all-people resistance. All the people should turn out as one in the all-people resistance to annihilate the aggressors and achieve national reunification once a war breaks out, being aware that they should certainly settle accounts with the U.S. imperialists, the sworn enemy of the Korean people. Kim Jong Un called for more dynamically struggling for the final victory of the socialist cause full of conviction and optimism about the future, believing in the inexhaustible strength of Juche Korea. Kim Jong Un Makes Closing Address at Seventh Congress of WPK Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- Supreme leader Kim Jong Un made the following closing address at the Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) Monday: Dear delegates, The historic Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea is now winding up its work upon making great successes amid the high degree of political enthusiasm and the best wishes and expectations from all the delegates, Party members, service personnel and other people. Through this Congress of the WPK we have fully displayed the invincible might of the great 23 Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist party and demonstrated to the whole world the unshakable conviction and will to accomplish the cause of socialism, the cause of the Juche revolution, under the unfurled banner of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. The Seventh Congress of the WPK will be etched for ever in the history of our Party as a glorious meeting of victors that laid lasting groundwork for the implementation of the cause of the Juche revolution and set up a new milestone in carrying out the cause of socialism. I am very gratified that this Congress of the WPK was convened at an important, historic turning point in implementing the cause of the Juche revolution and has an adequate discussion on the items on the agenda, and I extend warm thanks to all the delegates, Party members, service personnel and other people who made positive efforts to ensure the Congress a success. Comrades, Now as I am standing here before declaring the Seventh Congress of the WPK closed, I am reflecting on the grim decades of our Party that has travelled a long and arduous road. My yearning grows stronger for President Kim Il Sung and General Kim Jong Il who made so much painstaking efforts to the last moments of their great lives to hand down this powerful Korea to posterity tiding over the severe tempest of history. And this brings back vivid memories of the names and faces of the unforgettable revolutionary comrades who passed away earlier. They supported the leader's intentions and cause, showing no affectation and vacillation in both good and bad times, and worked with devotion for the development of the WPK and the victory of the socialist cause. Though they are not here with us, we should never forget the precious revolutionary comradesin-arms who went against all odds as genuine comrades of our Party and devoted themselves heart and soul to the WPK and the leader, the country and the people during the period under review. Comrades, Our Party and people are faced with very enormous tasks and imperialists and other hostile forces will keep persisting in their manoeuvres to hinder us. However, we will surely win final victory as the great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism brightly illumines the way ahead of us, there is the single-hearted unity of all the service personnel and people rallied firmly as one behind the WPK and the revolutionary armed forces infinitely faithful to the WPK are holding the red bayonet of invincibility. Let us all vigorously fight for the completion of the socialist cause, independent reunification of the country and victory of the cause of global independence, firmly united around the Central Committee of the WPK under the unfurled banner of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. Fully convinced that the revolutionary line and policies advanced by the Seventh Congress of the WPK will be carried out thoroughly and a great turn will be brought about in the implementation of the cause of the Juche revolution thanks to the indomitable spirit of offensive and heroic struggle of all the delegates and all Party members, service personnel and people who are unfailingly faithful to our revolution, I declare the historic Seventh Congress of the WPK closed. Decision of Seventh Congress of WPK Adopted Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- A decision ""On the review of the work of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea"" was adopted at the third-day meeting of the Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) held on May 8. The decision accepted the report on the review of the work of the Party Central Committee made by the respected Comrade Kim Jong Un as the immortal banner which indicated the bright road for the WPK and the developing revolution and a great programme that paved the path to be taken by the Juche revolution for all ages and fully supported and approved it. 26 The Seventh Congress of the WPK expressed the steadfast resolution to accelerate the victory of the cause of modeling the whole society on Kimilsungism and Kimjongilism, national reunification and the cause of global independence under the guidance of Kim Jong Un, holding President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il as the eternal leaders of the WPK in high esteem. It went on: We will push forward the work of modeling the whole society on Kimilsungism and Kimjongilism to strengthen the political, military and economic might in every way. All the fields will thoroughly implement the behests of the great leaders and strengthen the WPK, the state and army into those of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il forever. We will consolidate the position of the political and military power and fly the flag of victory on the eminence of the scientific and technological power, an economic giant and a highly civilized nation. We will take the general line of socialist construction and the principle of self-development as the constant strategic line, win a great victory in building a thriving socialist nation and successfully realize the historic cause of modeling the whole society on Kimilsungism and Kimjongilism. We will make a new leap forward in the development of the country's science and technology, open up an era prospering with science and bring about a revolutionary turn in socialist construction in a short span of time. We will work out the phased strategy for the national economic development in a scientific and realistic manner and carry it out without fail and carry through the five-year strategy for the state economic development from 2016 to 2020 for the present. We will accelerate the building of a highly civilized socialist country and thus bring up all the people to be able men for the socialist construction with profound knowledge and cultural attainments, and provide them with conditions and environment for leading a wealthy and a highly civilized life to their heart's content. We will accept it as the general duty to be held fast to in army building to model the entire army on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and thoroughly implement it. We stand for national reunification by federal formula and will make every possible effort for 27 peace and reunification. But if the south Korean authorities opt for a war, persisting in the unreasonable ""unification of social systems"", we will turn out in the just war to mercilessly wipe out the anti-reunification forces and achieve the historic cause of national reunification, longcherished desire of all the Koreans. We will make positive efforts to ensure durable peace on the Korean peninsula and reunify the country by federal formula under the banners of national independence and great national unity and thus build an independent and prosperous reunified country, the common desire of all Koreans, as soon as possible. We will regard the idea of independence, peace and friendship as the steadfast guidelines of our external activities, develop the good neighborly, friendly and cooperative relations with those countries which respect the sovereignty of the DPRK and remain friendly to it, and strive for regional peace and security and global independence. The WPK and the DPRK government will take to the invariable path of independence, Songun and socialism no matter how the situation and relationship with neighboring countries may change, and play a vanguard role as the defender of independence and justice in the struggle for global independence. We will wage a vigorous struggle to put a definite end to the danger of a nuclear war, imposed by the U.S., with a powerful nuclear deterrence and defend the regional and global peace. We will consistently take hold on the strategic line of simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force and boost self-defensive nuclear force both in quality and quantity as long as the imperialists persist in their nuclear threat and arbitrary practices. As a responsible nuclear weapons state, the DPRK will not use a nuclear weapon first unless its sovereignty is encroached upon by hostile aggression forces with nukes, as it had already declared, and it will faithfully fulfill its commitment to nuclear non-proliferation it made to the international community, and strive for the denuclearization of the world. The WPK and the DPRK government will get united and cooperate with all the countries and nations aspiring after independence and loving justice, irrespective of differences in ideology and social system, and improve and normalize the relations with those countries that respect the sovereignty of the DPRK and are friendly towards it, though they had been hostile toward it in the past. 28 We will steadily develop the WPK into the party of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and increase its leadership role in every way and thus bring about a fresh turn in the historic struggle for modeling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. The WPK would lead with confidence our people's revolutionary struggle and construction work along the road of victory, holding Kim Jong Un in high esteem at the top post of the Juche revolution. The Seventh Congress of the WPK expressed the belief that the entire party and all the people would get firmly united around Kim Jong Un and courageously wage the general offensive and general charge for the development of the party, accomplishment of the socialist cause, independent reunification of the country and global independence under the revolutionary banner of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.",delegate today hold historic seventh congress worker party korea amid grand struggle party entire army fill iron nerve confidence achieve final victory juche revolution

28.08.2016,Kim Jong-un,"Dear youth delegates, Feeling satisfied that the Ninth Congress of Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League, which is held in the stirring period when young people across the country are expediting general onward march to implement the decisions of the Seventh Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea, is doing its work successfully, I warmly congratulate all the youth delegates attending this congress. I also extend warm thanks and militant greetings to young people across the country, who are working miracles and feats at the posts of national defence and at the sites of building a powerful socialist country and thus fulfilling their honourable mission and duty as the young vanguard of the Party. I congratulate the members of the overseas Korean youth delegations attending the congress, and offer my warm compatriotic greetings to the overseas young compatriots, including those in Japan, and the youth and students in south Korea who are struggling for the independent reunification of their motherland and the prosperity of their nation. The Ninth Congress of Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League constitutes a landmark event in defending and adding eternal brilliance to the great Comrades Kim Il Sung’s and Kim Jong Il’s idea of and exploits in the youth movement and developing the youth league into invincible vanguard ranks as required by the new era. The 70 years of the youth league is a history of brilliant victories of the great leaders’ original idea of prioritizing young people and their wise leadership. It is also a history of the ardent loyalty and patriotic devotion with which the young people of Korea have supported the Party, the leader, the country and the people. Having made a start of the youth movement early in the flames of the anti-Japanese revolution, Comrade Kim Il Sung expounded the Juche-oriented idea of the movement and guided it at its every step, lavishing great trust and affection on young people. By dint of the line of prioritizing young people and his outstanding and seasoned leadership, Comrade Kim Jong Il developed the youth league into an organization that is unfailingly loyal to the Party and the leader and trained young people into reliable successors in carrying forward the lineage of Paektu, into warriors in accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche, thus opening a new heyday for the youth movement. That they regarded prioritizing young people as the most important of all state affairs and made it a strategic revolutionary line in the whole course of leading the revolution, and, by wisely leading the implementation of the line, gave a perfect solution to the youth problem for the first time in history and built a youth power without parallel in the world is an outstanding exploit performed by our great leaders. Indeed, the youth movement of Korea is the glorious Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist youth movement pioneered and developed by dint of their great ideas and wise leadership, and ours is Kim Il Sung’s and Kim Jong Il’s youth power built thanks to their ennobling trust and affection. The proud decades of victorious advance of the Juche-oriented youth movement are associated with the invaluable blood and sweat and heroic exploits of the young people who fought self-sacrificingly for the Party, the leader, the country and the people. In the gigantic and worthwhile struggle for achieving the country’s prosperity and people’s happiness, our young people have been educated in a revolutionary way and trained spiritually and physically, and have developed into a large, matchless contingent forming a thousand-fold, tens-of-thousand-fold fortress around the Party. Our young people are patriots and heroes whom we can be proud of before the world; that they have a large contingent of such trustworthy young people is a great blessing for the Workers’ Party of Korea and a source of pride for Korea, and this assures the great strength of our dignified state and its bright future. Today the youth league is faced with the heavy yet honourable task for ushering in a golden age of the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist youth movement by developing itself into the eternal youth organization of the great leaders as required by the new era of the Juche revolution and displaying its might as the Party’s advance force and wing in the efforts for implementing the decisions adopted at the Seventh Congress of the Party. If the youth league is to fulfil the sacred mission and duty it has assumed for the times and the revolution, it should model itself on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. Modelling the entire youth league as well as the entire Party and the entire army on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is the path our revolution should follow and the basic guarantee for accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche. It should hold fast to ideological education among young people as its main task and fully prepare all of them as genuine Kimilsungists-Kimjongilists. The youth league organizations at all levels should lay great stress on educating young people in the greatness of our leaders with the aim of preparing them as the young vanguard unfailingly faithful to the Party and the leaders. They should also step up education of young people in Kim Jong Il’s patriotism, revolutionary faith, anti-imperialist and class consciousness, and socialist morality, so that all of them become true patriots with ardent love for their country, hot-blooded fighters with indomitable revolutionary faith and unwavering anti-imperialist and class consciousness, staunch champions of the class struggle and cultured social beings with a high degree of cultural attainments and ennobling moral traits. The youth league organizations and young people should become the vanguard and shock brigade in building a powerful socialist country. To achieve breakthroughs in the vanguard of the struggle to this end is the basic duty proper to our young people who make up the Party’s militant reserve and the most vigorous of our social forces. All our young people, upholding the militant tasks advanced by the Seventh Congress of the Party, should honour their valuable title of heroic youth in our era, in the worthwhile struggle to build a powerful socialist country. “Let us fully demonstrate the resourcefulness and gallantry of the heroic youth in the general offensive for building a powerful socialist country!”—this is the militant slogan the youth league and young people should hold high in the present times. Young people should be the death-defying corps in the struggle to defend their socialist country, faithfully supporting our Party’s Songun-based revolutionary leadership. They are the advance force in carrying out the Songun revolution and the main force in safeguarding the country. All of them, bearing in mind our Party’s idea of prioritizing arms, should regard national defence as their most sacred duty and the highest expression of patriotism, and valiantly turn out in the struggle to defend the socialist country. The young service personnel of the Korean People’s Army and the Korean People’s Internal Security Forces, as befit the combatants defending the outposts of the anti-imperialist military front, the lifeline of our revolution, should firmly grasp the weapons of the revolution and the class and safeguard the defence lines of the country and its socialist system. At any time in the future we will surely confront the US imperialists, the sworn enemy of our people; they should create a new miracle of achieving victory in this life-or-death showdown. Youth and students should all cultivate ardent patriotism and a staunch spirit of defending the country, and take part in military training with a sincere attitude. In times of emergency they should take up arms and turn out as one in the all-people resistance to defend their beloved country, native homes and workplaces against the aggression of the enemy and their destructive and subversive moves. All our young people should resolutely counter the enemy’s schemes for ideological and cultural infiltration with great ideological and mental strength and unshakeable revolutionary faith, and take a tough stand to prevent any alien ideology and culture and unnatural lifestyle from penetrating our interior. They should uphold the self-development-first banner on all fronts for building a powerful socialist country and display their valiant offensive spirit and youthful courage in achieving new miraculous and innovative successes one after another. In implementing the Five-Year Strategy for National Economic Development they should raise fierce flames for collective competition, thereby setting new standards and new records and overfulfilling their daily, monthly and quarterly quotas for the national economic plan. The youth league organizations should push ahead with the Songun Youth Torch Prize movement, the youth shock brigade movement and other mass movements, the advantages and vitality of which have been confirmed in practice. They should launch vigorous campaigns in which one overtakes and learns from others and swaps experiences with them, and raise fierce flames for performing great exploits. Then new miraculous and innovative achievements will be made wherever young people are working, and youthful vigour will pervade the entire country. The youth league should carry out with credit major construction projects that will make a significant contribution to developing the economy and improving the people’s living standards, fully demonstrating the might of youth shock brigade. The more vigorously young people advance in response to the Party’s call demonstrating the might of the youth construction units, the more vibrantly the entire country will be seething and the greater progress will be made in implementing the cause of building a powerful socialist country. Young people should become the vanguard and pioneer in building a sci-tech power. Young scientists and technicians, keeping their feet firmly planted on this land and looking out over the world, should devote their creative wisdom and enthusiasm to the campaign to surpass the cutting edge, with a view to raising our country to the status of a sci-tech power as soon as possible. Young people should take the lead in making all the people well-versed in science and technology, and become masters of invention and technical innovation, rendering a positive contribution to modernizing the production lines and ensuring the domestic production of raw materials, fuel and equipment. Students should learn hard and accumulate knowledge, always holding books in their hands, and thus prepare themselves to contribute to promoting national prosperity by developing cutting-edge science and technology. Young people should become creators of socialist civilization and the vanguard in building a civilized power. They should play the core, vanguard role in building our country into a civilized socialist power as soon as possible by developing art and literature, sports and all other sectors of socialist culture in a comprehensive way. All of them, cherishing national pride and self-confidence that our own culture and lifestyle are the best, should hold dear all tangible and intangible heritage achieved by the preceding generations, and add lustre to our style of socialist culture. As demanded by the era when the general offensive for building a powerful socialist country is gaining momentum, they should bring the culture of heroic youth into full blossom and make the songs of revolution and struggle resound wherever they live and work. They should make strenuous efforts to tighten moral discipline. They should all respect their revolutionary forerunners, teachers and seniors, promote communal unity and family harmony, and observe public morality and order of life on a voluntary basis. They should contribute to economic construction and defence building with a sturdy physique developed amid the wind of mass-based sports and defence sports, and take the lead in turning the whole country into a socialist fairyland. They should wage a proactive struggle to achieve the independent reunification of the country and global independence. It is the young people, the sons and daughters of the nation and the future of the country, who ought to stand in the vanguard of the effort to accomplish the great national cause of putting an end to the long-standing suffering of national division and building on this land a dignified and prosperous reunified country. All the Korean young people in the north, in the south and abroad should hold aloft the banner of national independence and great national unity, join their minds and purposes on the patriotic road of reunification and fight in solidarity and collaboration. In this way, they can smash the obstructive moves of the US imperialists and other anti-reunification forces and open up a broad avenue to national reunification. Holding high the three charters for national reunification, the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the October 4 Declaration, provided by the great leaders, as grand programmes for national reunification, the youth league and young people should stand in the vanguard of the struggle for the independent reunification of the country and render positive support and encouragement to the struggle of the youth and students in south Korea for anti-US independence and national reunification and to the patriotic struggle of the overseas young compatriots. The youth and students in the south should wage a dynamic struggle to thwart the moves of the United States and its followers for aggression and war, who are attempting to bring a nuclear holocaust to our nation, and to have the historic agreements common to the nation respected and implemented. By doing so, they can open up a new phase for the development of inter-Korean relations and national reunification. Those in Japan and other overseas Korean young people should, with pride and self-respect of being members of the dignified Korean nation, render characteristic contributions to the patriotic cause for the independent reunification of their country and prosperity of their socialist motherland. The youth movement of Korea is closely related to the world youth movement, and the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League is faced with an important task for contributing to securing genuine international justice and realizing the cause of global independence by strengthening unity and cooperation under the unfurled banner of anti-imperialist independence with the progressive young peoples of the world, who champion independence. The youth league should apply the idea and principles of our Party’s foreign policy to cementing anti-imperialist solidarity, friendship and unity with the world’s progressive young peoples and proactively contributing to the development of the world youth movement. In order to usher in a golden age in the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist youth movement, the youth league should strengthen its organizations and enhance their militant functions and role in every way possible. The major link in the whole chain of the efforts for developing the youth league is to strengthen its primary organizations, which are its grass-roots organizations and basic combat units. The youth league committees at all levels should go down to the primary organizations on a regular basis, improve the qualifications and capabilities of the primary officials and help them in a responsible way so that the officials can work with the youth league members effectively. In particular, city and county youth league committees, the guidance units at the lowest level, should properly get acquainted with the work of their primary organizations, effectively guide them and give them positive help. Youth league organizations should intensify the organizational life of their members so as to ensure that this life is turned into a course of a school in which they are educated and trained in a revolutionary way. The youth league should direct great efforts to strengthening the organizations of the Children’s Union, its successor, and educating the union members properly. Youth league committees at all levels should regard guidance over the work of the Children’s Union as one of their tasks, and ensure that school education, family education and social education are closely linked for educating the Children’s Union members. In this way they can prepare all the members and organizations of the Children’s Union to be the children’s vanguard faithful to our Party. It is important to build up the ranks of the youth league officials and further enhance their sense of responsibility and role. All the youth league officials should be well aware of their tasks in the struggle to usher in a golden age of the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist youth movement, and execute them creditably. Party guidance over the work of the youth league should be further improved. The organizations and officials of the Party should bear in mind the intention of the Party Central Committee to prioritize the work with young people and intensify their policy-oriented guidance and political leadership in order to ensure that the work of the youth league in their respective regions and units is conducted properly in line with the Party’s ideas and intentions. A Party-wide campaign should be launched to create model, exemplary units in Party guidance over the work of the youth league and generalize their experience so as to make sure that loving young people and rendering positive support to the work of the youth league becomes a trait of the Workers’ Party of Korea. The climate of prioritizing and loving young people should pervade the whole country. A broad vista is open before the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League and our young people storming ahead along the course of the Korean revolution indicated by the Party Central Committee, and the eternal brilliant future of the youth movement of Korea is assured. Let us all struggle dynamically for the accom-plishment of the Juche-oriented socialist cause, for the modelling of the youth league on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and towards the bright future of the youth power.

27.09.2016,Kim Jong-un,"I extend warm congratulations to all the teaching staff and students of Kim Il Sung University who are greeting the meaningful 70th anniversary of its founding at this historic time when a general offensive is in full swing to build a powerful socialist country according to the bright blueprint unfolded by the Seventh Congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea. Kim Il Sung University is the central base for training national cadres and the highest institute of Juche-based science and education. The history of the university is a history of the shining victory of the Juche-oriented ideas and theories of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il on education and their outstanding leadership; it is also a history resplendent with the patriotic and faithful service of all its teaching staff, students and graduates who have worked with devotion for the victorious advance of the revolutionary cause and the prosperity of their country, cherishing infinite loyalty to the Party and the leaders. Regarding education, the training of native cadres, as the most important of all national affairs since it has a bearing on the destiny of the country and nation, Comrade Kim Il Sung had the university built as a priority even in the difficult and complex situation that prevailed after the country’s liberation. The founding of this university marked the beginning of a new history of Juche-based and people-oriented higher education for training the people’s sons and daughters into dependable pillars of a new Korea, into native cadres, and it opened broad prospects for building a prosperous and independent people’s state by relying on our native cadres. In every period and at every stage of the revolution and construction, including the difficult days of building a new 1 country and the trying days of the Fatherland Liberation War, Comrade Kim Il Sung indicated the road the university should follow and led it at every step so that it could train large numbers of the fine native cadres needed by the Party and the revolution. Thanks to his wise leadership and uncommon care, a solid foundation was laid for developing it into a model university in training talented revolutionaries, and for transforming the Ryongnam Hill area into a world-class university district. Comrade Kim Jong Il always showed close concern for the work of the university, and he wisely led it so that it could creditably perform the mission and tasks it had assumed before the times and the revolution. Remembering the historic resolve he made on Ryongnam Hill in his early days, he energetically led the university to establish the Juche orientation in its educational work, and had it developed into the university of Comrade Kim Il Sung the lifeblood of which is faithfulness to the leader, into the highest institute of Juche-based science and education. Etched on the hearts of our people, including the teaching staff and students of the university, is the august image of the great General, who unfolded the plan of building it into one of the most prestigious universities in the world and, despite the mental and physical fatigue he accumulated on the road of the Songun revolution, put his heart and soul into creating world-class educational conditions and a world-class environment for the university. The great leaders were, indeed, founders and builders of the university and benevolent fathers and mentors of its teaching staff and students, and the university, which was born and developed under their warm care, is the university of the leaders both in name and in reality. There are many famous universities in the world that are proud of their long history and time-honoured traditions, but 2 Kim Il Sung University is the only one that glories in the great name of the Sun revered by the world and shines with the imperishable leadership exploits of the national leaders. Our Party pays close concern to defending and honouring for all ages the imperishable revolutionary exploits performed by the great leaders for the development of the university and to developing it further into a most prestigious university in line with the requirements of the times and the developing revolution. Since its founding, the university has, under the leadership of the great leaders and the Party, played the pivotal role in training national cadres and developing the country’s science and technology. In line with the Party’s education policy, the teachers and scientists at the university have trained large numbers of talented revolutionaries who are politically and ideologically sound and scientifically and technologically prepared; they have also proved the validity of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and Party policy, given wide publicity to them and found wonderful solutions to the scientific and technological problems arising in developing the economy and culture and in consolidating our national defence capability. In this way they have made a positive contribution to advancing the revolutionary cause of Juche to victory. In every grim decade of our revolution its students have defended the Party and the leaders staunchly and stood in the vanguard and defied death in executing the Party’s plans and intentions. Its graduates, cherishing the great political trust and expectations of the Party and the leaders, have worked with devotion for the development of our Party and Republic. They are now performing their responsibilities and basic duty as the core of the Party and the revolution, as the vanguard fighters, at 3 the major sites where a powerful socialist country is being built. Invariably following the Party with a single mind along the road of loyalty and patriotism, the university has produced the dependable hard core of the Party and the state as well as many competent specialists in several fields, who will creditably carry forward the revolutionary cause of Juche to completion. It has forcefully propelled the building of a powerful socialist country by achieving fruitful results in scientific research. This constitutes an outstanding exploit performed by the university for the country and the revolution. While striving hard to implement the instructions the great leaders gave in their lifetime, the university has trained some outstanding educational and scientific personnel, including academicians, professors and doctors, and particularly young scientists of a new generation who have won recognition in world scientific circles; colleges, faculties and departments have been incorporated into it as appropriate for a university; its educational equipment has been upgraded and put on a high-level IT footing, and well-equipped bases have been built for manufacturing cutting-edge products. In this way the foundations have been laid for building it up into one of the most prestigious universities in the world. Today the Ryongnam Hill area has been turned into a vast university district centred on the bronze statues of Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. As a witness to history that comprehends the great leaders’ imperishable exploits in developing Juche-oriented education and science and building a thriving country and eloquently proves the validity of our Party’s idea and line on prioritizing education and talents, the district shines brilliantly as the sacred place where the dawn of final victory in the Juche revolution is being ushered in. On behalf of the Workers’ Party of Korea and the government 4 of the Republic I extend warm thanks to all the teaching staff, students and graduates of Kim Il Sung University who, fully conscious of the heavy responsibility and mission they are bearing for the Party and the revolution, the country and the people, have displayed noble loyalty and patriotic devotion over the past seven decades, rendering great service to developing the university and implementing the revolutionary cause of Juche. Today the university is faced with the ennobling task of making a positive contribution to carrying out the cause of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism by training a greater number of talented revolutionaries who are faithful to the Party and the revolution and have excellent practical abilities. It is also charged with forcefully propelling the building of a powerful socialist country through successful research accomplishments in cutting-edge science, as demanded by the new era of the Juche revolution. If the university is to perform with credit the mission and duty it has assumed before the times and the revolution, it should be developed as the eternal university of the great leaders. To ensure that it invariably maintains its revolutionary character and original features as the university of the leaders and to develop itself into the university of the great leaders that maintains its prestige in the eyes of the world–this is the general direction for developing Kim Il Sung University in the new era of the Juche revolution. The university should be steadfast in defending its proud history and tradition of regarding loyalty to the Party and the leader as its lifeblood, and it should glorify them generation after generation, century after century. The great leaders’ undying exploits and instructions are the lasting foundation and guideline for developing Kim Il Sung University. The university should maintain the great leaders’ 5 Juche-oriented ideas, theories and instructions on education as its permanent programme and apply them comprehensively in its overall work. In this way it can realize the leaders’ plan and desire for making it one of the most prestigious universities in the world. Loyalty to the Party’s ideology and leadership is the lifeblood of Kim Il Sung University. The university should, by intensifying the work of establishing the Party’s unified leadership system, turn itself into the epitome of conviction and loyalty which faithfully supports the Party’s ideology and leadership and keeps pace with the Party Central Committee at all times. By steadily carrying forward its glorious tradition as the university of the great leaders, it should ensure that the whole campus brims over with the revolutionary spirit of defending the Party Central Committee and implementing Party policy to the death. It is essential to develop the university into one of the most prestigious universities in the world as befits the dignified, revolutionary university of the great leaders. A key task in this regard is to combine education closely with scientific research and put the main emphasis on training creative talents and developing cutting-edge scientific theories and technologies. The university should improve the content of its education, its teaching methods, its education system and its teaching management in conformity with the characteristics of the most prestigious universities. It should do this by setting clear-cut objectives for training talents at every stage of education, ranging from regular and postgraduate courses to research. While prioritizing political and ideological subjects, it should improve the teaching of other subjects by adhering to Party 6 policy and encouraging theoretical explanation in plain language. In this way it can fully guarantee the politico-ideological character of the content of education. It should conduct an overall review of the teaching programmes for all subjects and update them on the principle of ensuring their practicability, comprehensiveness and modernity, and compile world-class textbooks of our own. Kim Il Sung University should set an example for all the other universities in the country in introducing innovative teaching methods. It should train its students into positive learners and researchers by developing and perfecting a heuristic teaching method of our style in line with the requirements of the times, and conduct education in close combination with scientific research and practical activities. It should create processes, means, methods and forms of teaching to suit the reality of our country and the characteristics of the relevant subjects, and actively apply them. It is important to proactively enlist the students in regular courses as well as postgraduate courses in scientific research, increase the proportion of experiments, internships and skills training in the direction of improving their applicability, and set up a scientific method of evaluating the practical abilities of students with the focus on their application capability. It should organize teaching units in a logical way, and ensure that students receive lectures from leading teachers at the university and from across the country through various forms and methods of education. It should fix reasonable teaching hours for the teachers, based on the principle that highly-qualified, authoritative teachers and researchers give the main lectures on their respective subjects. The education system, teaching management and educational 7 administration should be improved. The university should establish a well-regulated continuous education system, ranging from regular to postgraduate courses, and ensure that the genius education system established by General Kim Jong Il proves its worth in practice. In conformity with its character as a university, it should develop new colleges, faculties and departments for training personnel who are talented in cutting-edge and other major fields such as aerospace technology and the chemical industry. It should also develop new branches of cross-disciplinary sciences in line with the trend of the comprehensive development of science and the demands of the country’s socio-economic development, and nurture outstanding talents for these fields. The university should develop its faculties and departments with a certain level of foundations and with particular attainments so that they become capable of securing world supremacy, and it should launch a dynamic campaign in which one overtakes and learns from others so as to increase the number of these faculties and departments. A rational system and order for educational administration should be established on the principle of ensuring the smooth progress of teaching and scientific research by teachers and researchers, and of the edification of students. Departments should be strengthened into academic centres for relevant sectors, into authoritative research units, in which teaching is closely combined with scientific research. Kim Il Sung University should build up its distance education college into a nationwide online educational base for the social sciences and increase the number of its courses and students so as to develop it into a large-scale college. In this way the university can make a tangible contribution to implementing our Party’s policy of making all the people well-versed in science 8 and technology. The university should take decisive steps to strengthen the forces of science and education that are capable of building it up into a most prestigious university. The main forces, who are directly responsible for doing so, are its forces of science and education centred on its teachers and researchers. The university should train on a long-term basis reserve scientists and educationists for every discipline so as to strengthen these forces in terms of both quality and quantity, and it should ensure that their legacy is carried forward. It should direct great efforts to the work of the institutes of social and natural sciences so as to ensure that their research fellows make outstanding achievements in their research projects in cutting-edge branches and, in the course of this, grow to be world-class scholars. The university should be vigorous in conducting scientific research and become a pacesetter in realizing the integration of education, scientific research and production. In scientific research, it should focus on satisfactorily resolving the theoretical and practical, scientific and technological problems arising in building a powerful socialist country, on developing the sector of basic sciences and on pushing back the frontiers of science and technology. The social sciences sector should add eternal glory to the immortal revolutionary careers and achievements of the great leaders, explain and verify the originality, truthfulness, veracity and vitality of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and the Party’s lines and policies in a deep-going way, and give wide publicity to them. The natural sciences sector should make a positive contribution to solving the scientific and technological problems, including those related to food and energy, that are pressing 9 matters in developing the national economy and consolidating our national defence capability. The sectors of basic sciences and cutting-edge science and technology should present research results with a world competitive edge. It is important in building the university up into a most prestigious one to achieve the integration of education, scientific research and production. True to the instructions Comrade Kim Jong Il gave in his lifetime, the university should consolidate the successes it has gained in building the bases for conducting research into cutting-edge technology and developing intellectual products, and at the same time, build more of such bases and update its technical services, so as to apply them proactively to education, and contribute to setting up cutting-edge industries in the country. It should push ahead purposefully with the work of building itself up as a hub of international academic exchange. The university should organize regular international academic seminars, either by discipline or of a comprehensive nature, and expand its joint research with leading universities and research institutes in other countries. It should ensure that its most outstanding academic papers are presented at authoritative international seminars and submitted for publication in international academic journals. The Bulletin of Kim Il Sung University should be designated as a specialist academic periodical of the country and developed into a world-famous one. The bulletin and books published by the university, including textbooks and reference books, should be authoritative enough, for them to be used in other countries as well as by itself and throughout our country. It should enrol many foreign students and give them regular, postgraduate and internship courses in Korean and other 10 specialist disciplines; it should also send its students, postgraduates in particular, abroad for further study. Its teachers and researchers should decisively enhance their sense of responsibility and role, and its students should heighten their zeal for learning. The university’s teachers and researchers are career revolutionaries who are training the hard core of the revolution, world-class talents. Today, when the university is charging forward to beat the world, they have assumed a very heavy responsibility and duty before the Party and the country. They should keep the Party’s revolutionary ideas and theories as an article of their firm faith and be possessed of an ennobling view on the rising generation, sound mental and moral traits and pure conscience as teachers. They should be loyalists to the Party and the revolution who are strong in ideology and faith, before being teachers and scientists. No matter how excellent their practical abilities may be, teachers and researchers who are devoid of strong faith cannot make a genuine contribution to the Party and the revolution. Fully aware that they bear the responsibility for the future of the country, they should devote their all to teaching and scientific research. Their qualifications are represented in their students’ academic abilities and their own achievements in scientific research. They should raise a hot wind of improving their qualifications and competing to raise their practical abilities so as to develop themselves as model teachers and authoritative, world-class scholars without rival in their field. They should become genuine educationists who teach their students through their personal examples and enjoy the love and respect of officials and the working people as well as their students for their great practical abilities, ennobling traits and outstanding achievements. 11 The students of Kim Il Sung University are reserve hardcore talents who will become leading officials of the revolution responsible for the key sectors and posts in the building of a powerful socialist country, the backbone in the struggle for the victory of the Juche revolution. They should become true revolutionaries who cherish the great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism as an article of their faith. They should be talented revolutionaries of the Juche type, creative talents, who are possessed of the intellectual ability to beat the world, as well as of lofty and highly-civilized cultural attainments. Keeping in mind the proposition of the great General Kim Jong Il inscribed on the front wall of the lobby in the university’s e-library, all the students at the university should study hard with a high ambition to become the backbone of the revolution, competent personnel in the new century, who will add brilliance to Kim Il Sung’s nation, Kim Jong Il’s Korea, before the eyes of the world. Fully aware that they themselves hold the key to success in their university days, they should improve themselves spiritually and morally, and use every minute to broaden and enrich their knowledge and apply it in practice. We are competing with the world, and it is the students of Kim Il Sung University who must stand at the forefront of this competition. They should fully demonstrate the dignity and honour of Kim Il Sung University by blazing a trail for the development of cutting-edge science with the ambition of challenging the world, competing with the world and beating the world with their brain-power. The university should make sure that all aspects of university life, including the provision of education, activities in political organizations and the establishment of discipline, are geared and subordinated to raising among the students a wind of learning 12 and improving their academic performance. The Party and the state should direct efforts to developing Kim Il Sung University into one of the most prestigious universities in the world. To develop the university as such is a task which our Party is now prioritizing. The Science and Education Department and other relevant departments of the Party Central Committee and the Pyongyang Municipal Party Committee should exert themselves to carry out this work as intended by the great General and the Party, and the sectors and units concerned should take a deep interest in the work of the university and help it proactively. The Cabinet and relevant organs should throw their full weight behind the work of developing Kim Il Sung University into a base for scientific and technological research, in which education, scientific research and production are integrated. They should supply the university with the modern apparatuses it needs for experiment and internship, printing equipment and teaching aids and furnishings as a top priority, and properly help it build up its internship and supply service bases so that its educational conditions and environment reach the world standard. Measures should be adopted by the state to improve the educational and scientific research conditions at the university and the living conditions of its teaching staff and students. The university should work out and implement strategies and attain one by one targets for developing itself into one of the most prestigious universities in the world on the principle of self-reliance and self-development and on a scientific and realistic basis in accordance with our actual conditions and the world trend. In doing so, it should reject sycophancy, dogmatism and imitation and, when following the good experience of others, it should not confine itself simply to adopting them, but strive to 13 attain a higher level. It should not turn to others for help, but renovate its teaching and scientific research facilities, develop its equipment and instruments for experiment and internship and build up its supply service base by relying on its own efforts and technology. The university district is located near the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il are preserved in their lifetime appearance, and as a large revolutionary site, it is heavily associated with the leadership of the great leaders. The teaching staff and students of the university should devote their unstained loyalty and patriotism to developing their university into an unrivalled, excellent base for education and edification, into the highest institute of science and education, and keeping it neat and tidy. The Party committees of Kim Il Sung University and its colleges should improve their functions and role. These Party committees should maintain, as their lifeline, carrying out the instructions of the great leaders and defending and exalting the brilliance of their leadership exploits. As everything at the university is associated with their leadership exploits, all the teaching staff and students should be encouraged to have a deep understanding of these exploits throughout their life on campus and seek the worth of life in maintaining and exalting their brilliance. They should bolster up policy-oriented guidance, or political guidance, so that all affairs, including educational administration, are focused on implementing the great leaders’ instructions and the Party’s line and policies on education. In particular, they should direct great efforts to developing the university into a most prestigious one with confidence and on a long-term basis, true to the intentions of the Party. Holding fast to the theory of our Party on prioritizing 14 ideology, they should launch among the teaching staff and students a dynamic and substantial campaign for carrying out the five-point education programme, with the stress on education in the greatness of the leaders. In this way, they can all be trained into people with indomitable ideological and spiritual qualities, into ardent patriots, vanguard fighters for their class, and people with a noble sense of morality. They should build up the ranks of teachers and researchers and organize and guide their Party life scrupulously to suit the characteristics of intellectuals. In this way they can give full play to the spiritual strength of all the teachers, researchers and leading officials at the university. Work with students constitutes an important undertaking which the Party committees of the university should prioritize and to which they should pay special attention. They should intensify their guidance to the students in their organizational and ideological activities so as to encourage them to study hard, and they should help them to acquire the revolutionary spirit and a sense of organization and discipline. They should lead the youth league organizations to conduct their work with the students in a creative and proactive way, with the main stress on comprehensively applying the study-first principle. They should ensure that the principle of prioritizing merit is observed in recruiting students, so that those who are qualified and promising are enrolled at the university. All officials should oppose the abuse of power, bureaucratism and corruption and maintain it as their revolutionary ethics inherent in themselves and the revolutionary Party climate to make selfless, devoted efforts on behalf of the teaching staff and students. They should also intensify ideological education and the ideological struggle for strictly preventing all manner of non-socialist practices and practices that tarnish the reputation of 15 the socialist education system from revealing themselves among the teaching staff and students. It is important to enhance the role of the university council and the university Party guidance committee. They should deal with important issues arising in improving education and scientific research at the university and its colleges and in developing the university into one of the most prestigious universities in the world. They should organize the work of developing the university into a prestigious university under a long-term plan and based on a methodology so that its colleges, faculties and departments compete to surpass the major indexes of the world’s most prestigious universities. The university council should be formed not only of officials from the university and its colleges but also of leading officials of the Party, the state and key units. This will enhance the authority of the council and heighten national and social interest in the university’s work. Our Party and people expect a great deal of Kim Il Sung University. When the university dynamically advances to beat the world, filled with confidence and vitality, the day of final victory in the Juche revolution will come earlier. I firmly believe that, true to the intentions of the Party Central Committee, all the teachers, researchers, officials and other staff members and students at Kim Il Sung University will fully discharge the noble mission and duty they have assumed before the times and the revolution by adding eternal brilliance to it as the university of the great leaders and proudly raising it to the front rank of the most prestigious universities in the world.",extend warm congratulation teaching staff student sung university greet meaningful anniversary founding historic general offensive full swing

01.01.2017,Kim Jong-un,"Dear Comrades, Having seen out 2016, in which we glorified each and every day with gigantic struggle, creating a new history of great prosperity unprecedented in the history of the Juche revolution, we are seeing in the new year 2017. Availing myself of this meaningful opportunity, when we look back with dignity upon the great year filled with proud miracles wrought by our great people, I, with the noblest mind, offer warm greetings to all the Korean people, who overcame with optimism trials of all hues unprecedented in history, sharing weal and woe with the Party and throwing in their lot with it by forming an integral whole with it in ideas, intention and will, and extend glory and blessing of the hope-filled new year to them. My warm greetings go also to the compatriots in the south and abroad and to the progressive peoples of the world and other foreign friends who aspire after independence and justice. The year 2016 was a year of revolutionary event, a year of great change, worthy of note in the history of our Party and country. Last year, amid the soaring revolutionary enthusiasm of all the Party members, service personnel and other people and great interest of the world, the Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea was held in a meaningful and splendid way as a grand political festival. The congress proudly reviewed our Party's glorious history of advancing the revolutionary cause of Juche along the victorious road under the wise leadership of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, and unfolded an ambitious blueprint for accomplishing the socialist cause under the banner of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. Through this historic congress, the iron will of our service personnel and people to continuously march along the road of Juche following the Party was fully demonstrated, and lasting groundwork for the Korean revolution was laid. It will be etched in the history of our country as a meeting of victors that demonstrated the invincible might of the great Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist party, as a glorious meeting that set up a new milestone in carrying out the revolutionary cause of Juche. Last year an epochal turn was brought about in consolidating the defence capability of Juche Korea, and our country achieved the status of a nuclear power, a military giant, in the East which no enemy, however formidable, would dare to provoke. We conducted the first H-bomb test, test-firing of various means of strike and nuclear warhead test successfully to cope with the imperialists' nuclear war threats, which were growing more wicked day by day, briskly developed stateof-the-art military hardware, and entered the final stage of preparation for the test launch of intercontinental ballistic missile; we achieved other marvellous successes one after another for the consolidation of the defence capability. This provided a powerful military guarantee for defending the destiny of the country and nation and victoriously advancing the cause of building a powerful socialist country. Our valiant People's Army reliably defended the security of the country and the gains of the revolution by resolutely frustrating the enemy's reckless moves for aggression and war, and gave perfect touches to its political and ideological aspects and military and technical preparations, as befits an invincible army. The brilliant successes achieved in the sector of national defence instilled a great national dignity and courage in our people, drove the imperialists and other reactionary forces into an ignominious defeat, and remarkably raised the strategic position of our country. Last year we achieved proud successes in the 70-day campaign and 200-day campaign organized for glorifying the Seventh Congress of the Party. These campaigns were a do-or-die struggle in which all the people smashed to smithereens the enemy's vicious schemes to isolate and suffocate our country and brought about a turning point on all fronts where a powerful socialist country is being built, a massive struggle of creation that gave birth to a new Mallima era. Thanks to the heroic struggle of the Kim Il Sung's and Kim Jong Il's working class and all other people, the ambitious goals the Party set for the 70-day campaign and 200-day campaign were attained with success and a fresh breakthrough was made in the development of the national economy. Our resourceful, talented scientists and technicians, following the successful launch of the earth observation satellite Kwangmyongsong 4, succeeded in the static firing test of new-type high-thrust motor of the launch vehicle for a geostationary satellite. By doing so, they have opened up a broad avenue to the exploration of outer space. Also, they established fully-automated, model production systems of our own style, bred high-yielding strains with a view to ramping up agricultural production and achieved other laudable scientific and technological breakthroughs one after another. All this will be of great significance in developing the country's economy and improving the people's livelihood. The electric-power, coal-mining, metallurgical, chemical and building-materials industries, rail transport and other major sectors of the national economy attained their respective production and transport goals, thereby demonstrating the potential of our self-supporting economy and giving a powerful impetus to the building of a socialist economic giant. Numerous industrial establishments and cooperative farms registered the proud success of surpassing the peak-year level. The People's Army stood in the vanguard in adding lustre to the history of ""gold seas"" and in creating a legendary speed at important construction sites. The sectors of education, public health and sports, too, made admirable achievements. When some areas in North Hamgyong Province were devastated by a sudden natural calamity, the whole country turned out in the restoration effort in hearty response to the Party's appeal and achieved a miraculous success in a short span of time. During the 70-day campaign and 200-day campaign we created a new spirit of the times for building a powerful socialist country, and our people's trust in the Party and confidence in socialism grew firmer. Last year, in which the whole country kept on seething with vigour day and night, all the Party members and other working people, youth and service personnel gave full scope to the indomitable attacking spirit of braving ordeals and difficulties, the deathdefying mettle of answering the Party's call with devotion and practice in any adversity, and the collectivist might of helping one another and leading one another forward to advance by leaps and bounds. The brilliant successes we achieved in all the sectors of the revolution and construction last year are by no means attributable to any good conditions, nor are they a fortuitous result of any divine power. The mysterious power that brought about all these miraculous successes is just the single-hearted unity of all the service personnel and people, their great capacity for self-development. Even though the enemy grew more blatant in their obstructive schemes and severe difficulties cropped up one after another, all the service personnel and people drew themselves closer together around the Party and waged a vigorous struggle in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. This was how they achieved the world-startling, miraculous successes under such trying circumstances. The single-hearted unity is the lifeblood of Juche Korea and the dynamic force for a leap forward, and we must invariably follow the road of self-reliance and self-development–this is the invaluable truth of the Juche revolution confirmed by our army's and people's gigantic struggle in 2016. I extend my heartfelt thanks once again to all the service personnel and people who, with unshakeable confidence in the final victory of the revolution, adorned last year, eventful and arduous, with laudable exploits by devoting their patriotic loyalty, sweat and blood to building a powerful socialist country. Comrades, We should turn out again in the new year's march towards a greater victory. To build on the successes already gained and turn a heyday in the revolution into a great golden age is an ideological and spiritual characteristic and work style of all our service personnel and people who were trained under the care of the great leaders. In this significant year, by further encouraging the revolutionary spirit that was heightened to an incomparable degree in the course of the previous miraculous year, we should make remarkable progress in the implementation of the decisions adopted at the Seventh Congress of the Party and thus translate the people's ideals and dreams into brilliant reality on this land. We should concentrate our efforts on implementing the five-year strategy for national economic development. This year is of key importance in carrying out this strategy. In order to open up fine prospects for the implementation of the strategy and develop the country's overall economy onto a higher plane, while building on the successes gained last year, we should attain the goals for this year's struggle without fail. ""Let us accelerate the victorious advance of socialism with the great spirit of self-reliance and self-development as the dynamic force!""–this is the militant slogan we should uphold in this new year's march. We should wage a vigorous allpeople, general offensive to hit the targets of the five-year strategy on the strength of self-reliance and selfdevelopment. The strength of self-reliance and self-development is that of science and technology, and the shortcut to implementing the five-year strategy is to give importance and precedence to science and technology. The sector of science and technology should concentrate efforts on solving scientific and technological problems arising in modernizing factories and enterprises and putting their production on a regular footing with the main emphasis on ensuring the domestic production of raw materials, fuel and equipment. Production units and scientific research institutes should intensify cooperation between themselves, and enterprises should build up their own technological development forces and conduct a proactive mass-based technological innovation drive, propelling economic development with valuable sci-tech achievements conducive to expanded production and the improvement of business operation and management. The electric-power, metallurgical and chemical industries should take the lead in the efforts to hit the targets of the economic strategy. The electric-power industry should carry out its production plan without fail by ensuring good maintenance of generating equipment and structures and stepping up its technical upgrading. It should run the nationwide integrated power control system effectively and organize alternated production scrupulously to ensure balance between power production and consumption; it should also develop the various sources of power to create a new generating capacity on a large scale. The metallurgical industry should introduce advanced technologies to lower the iron production cost and ensure normal operation of Juche-based production lines to turn out iron and steel in larger amounts. The state should take stringent measures to supply raw materials, fuel and power to the Kim Chaek and Hwanghae iron and steel complexes and other metallurgical factories. The chemical industry is a basis for all other industries and plays an important role in consolidating the independence of the economy and improving the people's living standards. This sector should revitalize production at the February 8 Vinalon Complex, expand the capacity of other major chemical factories and transform their technical processes in our own way, thus increasing the output of various chemical goods. It should direct efforts to establishing a C1 chemical industry to carry out the tasks at every stage promptly and satisfactorily. The coal-mining industry and the rail transport sector should meet the demands for coal and its transport by power stations and metallurgical and chemical factories on a top priority basis. The machine-building industry should be rapidly developed. Machine factories should step up their modernization, perfect the processes for the serial production of new-type tractors, vehicles and multi-purpose farm machines, and produce and supply different kinds of high-performance and quality machinery and equipment. This year light industry, agriculture and fishing industry should be radically developed to make greater progress in improving the people's living standards. Light industry should work out proper management strategies, regarding use of domestically available raw and other materials as their core, so as to revitalize production and bring about a turn in diversifying the range and types of consumer goods and improving their quality. It should normalize production in the mines and enterprises in the Tanchon area, so that they can prove effective in improving the people's living standards. The agricultural front, the major thrust in building an economic giant, should raise a strong wind of scientific farming and push forward the movement for increasing crop yield. It should widely introduce seeds of superior strains and scientific farming methods, whose advantages have been proved in practice, expand the area of land under two-crop farming, and be proactive in inventing and introducing high-performance farm machines. By doing so, it can attain the production goal of grains. It should adopt measures to run the livestock farming base in the Sepho area on a normal basis and increase the production of fruits, mushrooms and vegetables, so that the people can enjoy benefits from them. The fishing sector should conduct a dynamic drive for catching fishes and push perseveringly ahead with aquatic farming. It should build modern fishing vessels in a greater number and lay out a comprehensive fishing equipment production base in the east coast area, so as to consolidate the material and technical foundations of the fishing industry. The construction sector should complete the construction of Ryomyong Street at the highest level and concentrate its forces on the major construction projects including the building of the Tanchon Power Station, modernization of the Kim Jong Thae Electric Locomotive Complex and the development of the Wonsan area. It should also build more educational and cultural facilities and houses in an excellent way. Upholding the slogan of self-reliance and self-sufficiency, every field and every unit of the national economy should launch a dynamic struggle to increase production and practise economy to the maximum, and thus carry out the plan for this year on all indices. The whole country should turn out in land administration. We should further transform the appearance of the land of our country by building modern tree nurseries in provinces, perseveringly pressing on with the forest restoration campaign and conducting river management, road repair and environmental conservation on a planned basis. In order to bring about a turnabout in implementing the five-year strategy for national economic development, it is imperative to carry on economic guidance and business management with clear objectives and in an innovative way. The Cabinet and other economic guidance organs should work out tactics to ensure the sustainable economic development by putting the overall national economy definitely on an upward track, and implement them with an unflinching perseverance. All the fronts in the sector of culture including education, public health, sports, literature and the arts should effect a new, revolutionary upsurge to accelerate the building of a civilized power. The whole country and the whole society should launch a dynamic drive this year, a year of scientific education, to improve the facilities and environment for this education. The political and military position of socialism should be further cemented so that it can be an impregnable fortress. Single-hearted unity is the precious revolutionary legacy the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il bequeathed to us, and herein lies the invincible might of our style of socialism. All the service personnel and people should establish the ties of kinship with the Party, their hearts pulsating to the same beat as it, and unite closely behind it in ideology, purpose and moral obligation, so as to struggle staunchly to achieve the prosperity of the country. We should thoroughly apply the people-first doctrine, the crystallization of the Juche-oriented view on the people, philosophy of the people, in Party work and all the spheres of state and social life, and wage an intensive struggle to root out abuses of power, bureaucratism and corruption that spoil the flower garden of single-hearted unity. We should resolutely thwart the enemy's sinister and pernicious schemes to check the warm and pure-hearted aspiration of our people who follow the Party single-heartedly and to alienate the Party from them. In this year of the 85th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army, we should raise the fierce flames of increasing the military capability. The People's Army should conduct the Party's political work in a proactive manner, so as to ensure that it is pervaded with the ideology and intentions of the Party alone. It should designate this year as another year of training, another year of perfecting its combat preparedness, and ensure that all its units of different arms, services and corps raise a hot wind of perfecting their combat preparedness in order to train all its officers and men as a-match-for-a-hundred combatants, tigers of Mt Paektu, who are capable of annihilating any aggressor force at a stroke. Officers and men of the Korean People's Internal Security Forces and members of the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and Young Red Guards should prepare themselves politically and militarily and maintain full combat readiness to firmly defend the socialist system and the people's lives and property. Officials, scientists and workers in the defence industry, burning their hearts with the ""Yongil bomb spirit"" of the days of the anti-Japanese struggle and the revolutionary spirit of the workers of Kunja-ri of the days of the Fatherland Liberation War, should develop and produce larger quantities of powerful military hardware of our own style. By doing so, they can build up the arsenal of the Songun revolution. Success or failure of this year's struggle aimed at carrying out the decisions of the Seventh Congress of the Party depends on the role of Party and working people's organizations. Party organizations should concentrate their work on carrying out the Party's policies and the major revolutionary tasks advanced for their respective sectors and units. They should correctly identify the problems to which the Party attaches importance and which are the main links in the whole chain of bringing about an upsurge in production, and should resolve them by enlisting all their forces. They should move the theatre of political work to the seething production sites and launch a revolutionary ideological offensive there. In this way they can powerfully arouse the masses to the general mobilization struggle for carrying out the Party's ideas and policies. All the primary Party organizations, by applying the main spirit of the First Conference of Chairpersons of the Primary Committees of the Workers' Party of Korea, should ensure that the spirit of continuous innovations and continuous advance is displayed to the full in this year's all-people, general offensive. All the youth league, trade union, agricultural workers' union and women's union organizations should enlist their members and encourage them to be astir in the advance for great upsurge, and ensure that they become innovators, creators of the Mallima speed. The current stirring era demands that our officials, standard-bearers in carrying out the Party's policies, improve their working style and attitude in a revolutionary way. Our people's enthusiasm for labour is very high now; when this enthusiasm is supported by bold and scientific operations, effective command and personal examples of our officials, there is no fortress we cannot conquer and no difficulty we cannot overcome. All the officials, well aware of the noble mission they have assumed before the Party and revolution, should become locomotives that lead the masses in the vanguard of the ranks. They should plan their work in a big way with innovative insight, always think what to do and work in a keyed-up and militant way. They should resolutely break with defeatism, self-preservation, formalism and expediency, and devote their heart and soul to the struggle for carrying out the Party's plans and intentions. Last year, in reflection of the national desire for reunification and the requirements of the times, we put forward the Juche-oriented line and policy of reunification at the Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea and made strenuous efforts to this end. However, the south Korean authorities turned a deaf ear to our patriotic appeal and ignored our sincere proposal. Instead, they clung to their sanctions-and-pressure schemes against the DPRK and persisted in clamouring for a war against it, thus driving inter-Korean relations towards the worst catastrophe. Last year, south Korea witnessed a massive anti-""government"" struggle spreading far and wide to shake the reactionary ruling machinery to its foundations. This resistance involving all south Korean people, which left an indelible mark in the history of their struggle, was an outburst of pent-up grudge and indignation against the conservative regime that had been resorting to fascist dictatorship, anti-popular policy, sycophantic and traitorous acts and confrontation with their compatriots. This year we will mark the 45th anniversary of the historic July 4 Joint Statement and the 10th anniversary of the October 4 Declaration. This year we should open up a broad avenue to independent reunification through a concerted effort of the whole nation. Positive measures should be taken to improve inter-Korean relations, avoid acute military confrontation and remove the danger of war between north and south. The improvement of inter-Korean relations is the starting-point for peace and reunification, and it is a pressing demand of the whole nation. Any politician, if he or she remains a passive onlooker to the current deadlock between the two sides, can neither claim to be fully discharging his or her responsibility and role for the nation nor enjoy public support. Every manner of abuses and slanders aimed at offending the other party and inciting confrontation cannot be justified on any account, and an immediate stop should be put to the malicious smear campaign and other acts of hostility towards the DPRK, all designed for the overthrow of its system and any other ""change."" We are consistent in our stand to safeguard the security of the compatriots and peace of the country without fighting with the fellow countrymen. The south Korean authorities should not aggravate the situation by finding fault with our exercise of the right to self-defence thoughtlessly, but respond positively to our sincere efforts to prevent military conflict between north and south and ease the tension. They should also discontinue arms buildup and war games. The whole nation should pool their will and efforts to usher in a heyday of the nationwide reunification movement. All the Korean people in the north, in the south and abroad should achieve solidarity, make concerted efforts and unite on the principle of subordinating everything to national reunification, the common cause of the nation, and revitalize the reunification movement on a nationwide scale. They should promote active contact and exchange with each other irrespective of differences in their ideologies and systems, regions and ideals, and classes and social strata, and hold a pan-national, grand meeting for reunification involving all the political parties and organizations including the authorities in the north and south, as well as the compatriots of all strata at home and abroad. We will readily join hands with anyone who prioritizes the fundamental interests of the nation and is desirous of improving inter-Korean relations. It is necessary to frustrate the challenges of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad who go against the aspiration of the nation for reunification. We must put an end to the moves for aggression and intervention by the foreign forces including the United States that is occupying south Korea and tries to realize the strategy for achieving hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region, and wage a dynamic pan-national struggle to thwart the moves of the traitorous and sycophantic anti-reunification forces like Park Geun Hye who, failing to see clearly who is the real arch-enemy of the nation, is trying to find a way out in confrontation with the fellow countrymen. Well aware of the will of the Korean nation to reunify their country, the United States must no longer cling to the scheme of whipping up national estrangement by inciting the anti-reunification forces in south Korea to confrontation with the fellow countrymen and war. It must make a courageous decision to roll back its anachronistic policy hostile towards the DPRK. The international community that values independence and justice should oppose the moves of the United States and its vassal forces aimed at wrecking peace on the Korean peninsula and checking its reunification, and the neighbouring countries should act in favour of our nation's aspiration and efforts for reunification. All the fellow countrymen in the north, in the south and abroad should do something to make this year a meaningful year of a new phase in independent reunification by stepping up a nationwide grand march towards reunification through the concerted effort of the nation. Last year the imperialist reactionary forces' moves for political and military pressure and sanctions against our country reached an extreme. But they failed to break the faith of our service personnel and people in victory, and could not check the vigorous revolutionary advance of Juche Korea. We will continue to build up our self-defence capability, the pivot of which is the nuclear forces, and the capability for preemptive strike as long as the United States and its vassal forces keep on nuclear threat and blackmail and as long as they do not stop their war games they stage at our doorstep disguising them as annual events. We will defend peace and security of our state at all costs and by our own efforts, and make a positive contribution to safeguarding global peace and stability. Our Party and the government of our Republic will remain committed to the ideals of our foreign policy of independence, peace and friendship, expand and develop the relations of good-neighbourliness, friendship and cooperation with those countries championing independence, and make concerted efforts with them to ensure genuine international justice. Comrades, As I am standing here to proclaim the beginning of another year, I feel a surge of anxiety about what I should do to hold our people in greater reverence, the best people in the world who have warmly supported me with a single mind out of their firm trust in me. My desires were burning all the time, but I spent the past year feeling anxious and remorseful for the lack of my ability. I am hardening my resolve to seek more tasks for the sake of the people this year and make redoubled, devoted efforts to this end. Previously, all the people used to sing the song We Are the Happiest in the World, feeling optimistic about the future with confidence in the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. I will work with devotion to ensure that the past era does not remain as a moment in history but is re-presented in the present era. On this first morning of the new year I swear to become a true servant loyal to our people who faithfully supports them with a pure conscience. And I will push the effort to set up across the Party a revolutionary climate of making selfless, devoted efforts for the good of the people. As long as the great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is illuminating the road ahead of us and we have the single-hearted unity of all the service personnel and people around the Party, we are sure to emerge victorious. Let us all march forward dynamically towards a bright future, holding up the splendid blueprint unfolded by the Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea to develop ours into a powerful

07.06.2017,Kim Jong-un,"Dear delegates of the Korean Children's Union, Dear members of the Korean Children's Union across the country, First of all, greeting June 6, a special holiday for the KCU members who are a source of pleasure, pride, hope and future of the socialist country, I extend warm congratulations to all the KCU members, reflecting the best wishes of the people across the country. I also feel very pleased that the Eighth Congress of the KCU is being held in a splendid way amid the great concern and expectation of our Party and people, and offer warm greetings to the KCU delegates to the congress and all other members of the KCU. My greetings go to the KCU school instructors, its sub-branch teachers and parents who are making efforts to train KCU members into stout pillars of the country. The Eighth Congress of the KCU constitutes a meaningful occasion in powerfully demonstrating the daring mettle of its members, who are growing up filled with spirit, bringing their beautiful dreams and happiness into bloom under the care of the Workers' Party of Korea, and in developing the KCU into the eternally glorious Kim Il Sung's and Kim Jong Il's organization of children. Dear KCU delegates, The KCU is a Juche-oriented revolutionary organization of children, which the great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il founded and developed with utmost care; it is also a mass political organization of the Korean children, who are fully preparing themselves to be successors to the revolution and to the WPK and the youth league. The glorious and proud history of the KCU is a history resplendent with the brilliant victory of the idea on the Juche-oriented children's movement and leadership of the great Generalissimos, who valued and loved KCU members most and devoted their all for the rising generations. The great Generalissimos were benevolent fathers of our KCU members, the rising generations, who mingled with the children all their life and spared nothing for nurturing the future of the country. As it was led by them, the Korean children's movement could advance along a straight road following our Party alone just as sunflowers turn towards the sun, and KCU members could grow up happily with nothing to envy in the world, as successors to the revolution who will shoulder the future of the country. Over the past four years since the Seventh Congress of the KCU, its organizations across the country and millions of its members have lived up to the pledges they made in front of its flag, keeping pace with their vibrant motherland, which is advancing by leaps and bounds to the wonder of the world. KCU organizations have developed into lively and innovative revolutionary organizations that lead their members to cherish the gratefulness for the Party and their socialist country and preciousness of their organizations and collectives and to be good at studying and in the organizational life. Many KCU members have displayed unstained loyalty with which they hold the great Generalissimos in high esteem for ever and performed laudable deeds of devoting themselves for the sake of society, their collectives and fellows, moving the people and adding to the country's storehouse of prides. Today our dear KCU members are studying hard and training themselves physically and mentally with beautiful dreams and hope for tomorrow, and are actively conducting various socio-political activities and do-good-deeds movements, thus preparing themselves to be revolutionary personnel who will exalt the brilliance of socialist Korea. Seeing the dignified appearance of KCU members, the precious wealth of the country, who are enjoying boundless happiness and growing up as ardent young revolutionaries, masters of the future, our Party and people feel the greatest pleasure and the pride in waging the revolution. As the KCU is steadfastly carrying forward the soul of Paektu, a bright, promising future is in store for the Juche revolution, Kim Il Sung's nation and Kim Jong Il's Korea. In the name of the WPK and on behalf of all our people, I once again offer warm congratulations to KCU members across the country, who are growing up to be stout pillars of a powerful socialist nation by adding lustre to the KCU's glorious traditions from one generation to the next, and also to KCU school instructors and its sub-branch teachers, who are devoting themselves heart and soul to the bright future of our motherland. Proud delegates and all other members of the KCU, Today our Party, army and people, by tightening their belts, are braving all trials to increase the country's strength; this death-defying, vigorous struggle is ultimately aimed at ensuring that our rising generations enjoy all the benefits of socialism in the best country that is admired by the world. When our dear KCU members grow up cheerfully, uprightly and valiantly to be dependable pillars who will shoulder the everlasting future of our country, the inexhaustible strength of Juche Korea will increase to the maximum and the victorious advance of socialism will speed up. Availing yourselves of this Eighth Congress of the KCU, you should actively swap fine experience gained in your study, organizational life, socio-political activities and do-good-deeds movements, make a fresh determination and redouble your efforts. Developing the KCU into the eternal children's organization of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and of the WPK and training all its members into true sons and daughters, young revolutionaries, of the socialist country-this is the basic task facing KCU organizations at present. KCU members should become ardent young revolutionaries who are fully conversant with the greatness of the Party and the leader and the preciousness of their motherland and devote their all to the good of the country and the revolution. They should always bear in mind the benevolent care the great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il showed to ensure that they live happily with nothing to envy in the world, and display infinite loyalty in holding them in high esteem as the eternal Sun of Juche. Fully aware that the red KCU neckerchief is a part of the flag of the WPK and their dreams and ideals will come true only under this flag, they should at all times and in all places think and act true to our Party's intentions. The anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters and the heroes in the days of the Fatherland Liberation War and in the present Mallima era are models of a true revolutionary from whom our KCU members should take their cue. By following the ennobling examples set by these revolutionary forerunners and heroes, KCU members should all become fervent revolutionaries and heroes. The basic revolutionary task facing KCU members is to prepare themselves as able revolutionary personnel who are knowledgeable, morally sound and physically strong, pillars in the building of a powerful socialist country. The first and foremost task for KCU members is to study well. The height of their school records represents the height of our country's future national strength. KCU members, bearing deep in mind the earnest request of their motherland, teachers and parents, should study hard to build the tower of knowledge higher, so as to become world-class scientists and inventors. They should possess beautiful socialist moral traits. They should ardently love their country and fellow people, and devote their all for the sake of society, their collective and fellows. They should respect their teachers and seniors and approach them politely, observe social order and public morality voluntarily, and be honest and upright in their everyday life. Healthy body of KCU members is an asset of the country. Only when they grow up stoutly in good health can the country be full of vigour and become stronger. KCU members should conduct brisk sporting activities to build up their physique, foster bravery and gallantry, and possess the techniques of more than one sports event. KCU members should also take an active part in art group activities, improving their cultural attainments and bringing their artistic talents into full bloom by singing songs, reciting poems and playing musical instruments. They should devote their all to adding brilliance to the socialist system of our country. They should not become self-indulgent sons and daughters seeking their own happiness, but young patriots who, cherishing Kim Jong Il's patriotism, treasure all the assets our revolutionary forerunners created on this land at the cost of their sweat and blood, and tend every tree and every blade of grass in their country with earnest care. They should step up various socio-political activities and do-good-deeds movements so as to encourage their fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters in their heroic struggle to build a powerful socialist country and contribute to their country's economic development. They should hate imperialists and other class enemies, maintain sharp revolutionary vigilance against their schemes and mentally prepare themselves to fight, if the enemies dare invade the country, as bravely as the Children's Corps members did during the anti-Japanese armed struggle and the children's vanguard members in the days of the Fatherland Liberation War. They should, through organizational life, improve their sense of organization and discipline and exalt the honour of being members of the glorious Kim Il Sung's and Kim Jong Il's organization of children. The pledge they took in front of the KCU flag is the first vow they made to their motherland, and their life in KCU organizations is the process of political activities through which they keep this pledge. They should always love and treasure their organizations, observe organizational discipline on a voluntary basis and implement without fail the tasks assigned by their organizations. It is important in training them into true sons and daughters, young revolutionaries, of the socialist country to enhance the role of KCU organizations and improve guidance over its work. KCU organizations should ensure effectiveness in conducting the movement to learn from the glorious childhood of the great Generalissimos and the five-point educational work, so as to become revolutionary organizations that are unfailingly loyal to the Party. They should make great efforts to heighten their members' spirit of collectivism, independence and creativity, thus preparing them all to be masters who will shoulder the future of a powerful socialist country. The youth league assumes the heavy responsibility of properly guiding KCU members who have taken the first step towards organizational life. It should give scrupulous guidance over the work of the KCU by taking into account its members' preparedness and psychological features; in particular, it should render positive help to KCU school instructors and its sub-branch teachers so that they can steadily improve the work of the KCU with a high sense of responsibility and practical qualifications. It should build up the ranks of KCU activists and lead them to do the KCU work in an independent and creative way and become models for other members to emulate in studying and life. All Party members and other working people should treasure and love KCU members as assets of the country and pay close attention to their education and edification as their educators and parents. In this way, they can ensure that all KCU members grow up as dependable pillars of the country amid the interest and care of the whole society. Party organizations at all levels should regard KCU work as an important undertaking that has a bearing on the destiny of the country and nation and the future of our revolution, and give Party-oriented guidance to it. Dear KCU delegates, The future of KCU members is endlessly bright, and a powerful socialist country, in which the song ""We Are the Happiest in the World"" resounds loudly, is reserved for them. Our Party, which foresees the bright future of the Juche revolution in their beautiful traits and courageous and cheerful appearance, will spare nothing for them and defend their happy laughter and bright future. I firmly believe that all KCU members will live up to the expectations of our Party and all people by advancing straight ahead and dynamically along the road indicated by the Party, flying high the flag of the KCU May happiness and glory be on the road of KCU members, our reliable successors and future of our powerful motherland, socialist Korea",delegate child union member child union across

22.09.2017,Kim Jong-un,"The speech made by the U.S. president in his maiden address on the UN arena in the prevailing serious circumstances, in which the situation on the Korean peninsula has been rendered tense as never before and is inching closer to a touch-and-go state, is arousing worldwide concern. Shaping the general idea of what he would say, I expected he would make stereo-typed, prepared remarks a little different from what he used to utter in his office on the spur of the moment as he had to speak on the world's biggest official diplomatic stage. But, far from making remarks of any persuasive power that can be viewed to be helpful to defusing tension, he made unprecedented rude nonsense one has never heard from any of his predecessors. A frightened dog barks louder. I'd like to advise Trump to exercise prudence in selecting words and to be considerate of whom he speaks to when making a speech in front of the world. The mentally deranged behavior of the U.S. president openly expressing on the UN arena the unethical will to ""totally destroy"" a sovereign state, beyond the boundary of threats of regime change or overturn of social system, makes even those with normal thinking faculty think about discretion and composure. His remarks remind me of such words as ""political layman"" and ""political heretic"" which were in vogue in reference to Trump during his presidential election campaign. After taking office Trump has rendered the world restless through threats and blackmail against all countries in the world. He is unfit to hold the prerogative of supreme command of a country, and he is surely a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire, rather than a politician. His remarks which described the U.S. option through straightforward expression of his will have convinced me, rather than frightening or stopping me, that the path I chose is correct and that it is the one I have to follow to the last. Now that Trump has denied the existence of and insulted me and my country in front of the eyes of the world and made the most ferocious declaration of a war in history that he would destroy the DPRK, we will consider with seriousness exercising of a corresponding, highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history. Action is the best option in treating the dotard who, hard of hearing, is uttering only what he wants to say. As a man representing the DPRK and on behalf of the dignity and honor of my state and people and on my own, I will make the man holding the prerogative of the supreme command in the U.S. pay dearly for his speech calling for totally destroying the DPRK. This is not a rhetorical expression loved by Trump. I am now thinking hard about what response he could have expected when he allowed such eccentric words to trip off his tongue. Whatever Trump might have expected, he will face results beyond his expectation. I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U. S. dotard with fire.",maiden address arena prevail serious circumstance situation peninsula render tense never before inch close touch arouse worldwide concern shape general expect stereo type prepare remark little different utter office spur moment have speak big diplomatic stage far make remark persuasive power view helpful defuse tension unprecedented rude nonsense never hear predecessor frightened dog bark louder advise trump exercise prudence select word considerate whom speak make front mentally deranged behavior openly express arena unethical totally destroy sovereign beyond boundary threat regime change overturn social system make those normal thinking faculty think discretion composure remark remind word political layman political heretic be vogue reference trump during presidential election campaign take office trump render restless threat blackmail country unfit hold prerogative supreme command surely rogue gangster fond play fire rather than politician remark describe option straightforward expression convince rather than frightening stop path choose correct follow last now trump deny existence insult front eye ferocious declaration war history destroy dprk consider seriousness exercise corresponding high level hard countermeasure history action good option treat dotard hard hearing utter want man represent dprk behalf dignity honor own man hold prerogative supreme command pay dearly call totally destroy dprk rhetorical expression love trump now think hard response expect allow eccentric word trip off tongue whatever trump expect face result beyond expectation surely definitely tame mentally derange dotard fire
01.01.2018,Kim Jong-un,"Dear fellow countrymen and brave service personnel of the People's Army, Dear compatriots, Today, recollecting with great pleasure and pride and deep emotion the proud achievements we performed last year through our diligent and worthwhile labour and sincere efforts and by the sweat of our brow, we are all seeing in the new year 2018 with fresh hopes and expectations. Greeting the hope-filled new year, I wish the families across the country good health, happiness, success and prosperity. I also wish that the beautiful dreams of all our people, including the hopes of our children in the new year, would come true. Comrades, As I look back upon last year, when I worked strenuously on the road of achieving national prosperity, gaining great strength and wisdom from the pure minds of the dauntless people who invariably trusted and followed the Party even in the face of manifold difficulties and trials, I feel my heart swelling with the pride in waging the revolution shoulder to shoulder with a great people. On behalf of the Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, I extend sincere thanks and New Year greetings to all the people and service personnel who won miraculous victories to be noteworthy in the national history of 5 000 years by sharing mind and purpose with the Party and supporting its determination on the road of arduous yet glorious struggle. My New Year greetings go also to the compatriots in the south and abroad who are fighting for the reunification of the country and to the progressive peoples and other friends across the world who opposed war of aggression and gave firm solidarity to our cause of justice. Comrades, The year 2017 was a year of heroic struggle and great victory, a year when we set up an indestructible milestone in the history of building a powerful socialist country with the spirit of self-reliance and self-development as the dynamic force. Last year the moves of the United States and its vassal forces to isolate and stifle our country went to extremes, and our revolution faced the harshest-ever challenges. In the face of the prevailing situation and the worst trials on the road of advance, our Party trusted the people and the people defended the Party death-defyingly, turning adversity and misfortune to good account and achieving brilliant successes on all the fronts where a powerful socialist country is being built. Through last year's grandiose struggle we powerfully demonstrated at home and abroad our immutable faith and will to follow to the end the road of Juche-oriented socialism opened up by the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and the single-hearted unity of socialist Korea in which all the people are firmly united behind the Party. An outstanding success our Party, state and people won last year was the accomplishment of the great, historic cause of perfecting the national nuclear forces. On this platform one year ago I officially made public on behalf of the Party and government that we had entered the final stage of preparation for the test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. In the past one year we conducted several rounds of its test launch, aimed at implementing the programme, safely and transparently, thus proving before the eyes of the world its definite success. By also conducting tests of various means of nuclear delivery and super-intense thermonuclear weapon, we attained our general orientation and strategic goal with success, and our Republic has at last come to possess a powerful and reliable war deterrent, which no force and nothing can reverse. Our country's nuclear forces are capable of thwarting and countering any nuclear threats from the United States, and they constitute a powerful deterrent that prevents it from starting an adventurous war. In no way would the United States dare to ignite a war against me and our country. The whole of its mainland is within the range of our nuclear strike and the nuclear button is on my office desk all the time; the United States needs to be clearly aware that this is not merely a threat but a reality. We have realized the wish of the great leaders who devoted their lives to building the strongest national defence capability for reliably safeguarding our country's sovereignty, and we have created a mighty sword for defending peace, as desired by all our people who had to tighten their belts for long years. This great victory eloquently proves the validity and vitality of the Party's line of simultaneously conducting economic construction and building up our nuclear forces and its idea of prioritizing science, and it is a great historic achievement that has opened up bright prospects for the building of a prosperous country and inspired our service personnel and people with confidence in sure victory. I offer my noble respects to the heroic Korean people who, despite the difficult living conditions caused by life-threatening sanctions and blockade, have firmly trusted, absolutely supported and dynamically implemented our Party's line of simultaneously promoting the two fronts. My warm, comradely greetings go also to our defence scientists and workers in the munitions industry who made devoted efforts all the year round, to demonstrate to the world that the plans and decisions of the Party Central Committee are a science and a truth and that they automatically mean their materialization. Last year we also made notable headway in carrying out the five-year strategy for national economic development. As a result of our vigorous endeavour to establish the Juche orientation in the metallurgical industry, an oxygen-blast furnace of our own style was built at the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex to maintain regular production of pig iron by relying on anthracite, and prospects were opened up for consolidating the independent foundations of the chemical industry and attaining the five-year strategy's goal for the output of chemical products. Numerous light-industry factories in such sectors as textile, footwear, knitwear and foodstuff industries raised high the banner of Juche orientation and made proactive efforts to propel the modernization of several production lines by means of our own technology and our own equipment. By doing so, they provided a guarantee for making the range of consumer goods varied and improving their quality. The machine-building industry, by upholding the banner of self-reliance and relying on science and technology, creditably attained the Party's goal for the production of new-type tractors and trucks, and thus laid solid foundations for speeding up the Juche orientation and modernization of the national economy and the comprehensive mechanization of the rural economy. The agricultural sector, by actively introducing scientific farming methods, increased the ranks of high-yield farms and workteams and reaped an unusually rich fruit harvest in spite of unfavourable climatic conditions. Our service personnel and people built magnificent Ryomyong Street and the large-scale livestock farming base in the Sepho area, and completed the task for the first stage of the forest restoration campaign, thereby demonstrating the might of great army-people unity and the potential of the socialist independent economy. Amid a vigorous struggle for the creation of the Mallima speed, new model units emerged one after another, and a large number of factories and enterprises fulfilled their quotas of the yearly national economic plan ahead of schedule and made a proud achievement of surpassing their peak-year levels. Successes were also made on the scientific and cultural fronts last year. Scientists and technicians resolved scientific and technological problems arising in the building of a powerful socialist country and completed research projects in the cutting-edge field, thereby giving stimulus to economic development and the improvement of the people's living standards. The socialist education system was further improved and the educational environment upgraded, while medical service conditions were bettered. An example of artistic performance activities was created to infuse the whole country with revolutionary optimism and the militant spirit, and our sportspeople won victories in different international competitions. All the successes made last year are the triumph of the Juche-oriented revolutionary line of the Workers' Party of Korea and a precious fruition of the heroic struggle of the service personnel and people who are firmly rallied behind the Party. Our Party and people achieved such signal victories others could never think of achieving by their own efforts in the face of the sanctions-and-blockade moves the United States and its vassal forces perpetrated more viciously than ever before to stamp out the rights to sovereignty, existence and development of the DPRK. Herein lies the source of their dignity and their great pride and self-confidence. I would like to extend my warm thanks once again to all the people and service personnel who victoriously advanced the cause of building a powerful socialist country, always sharing the destiny with the Party and braving all difficulties and trials on the eventful days of last year. Comrades, This year we will mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the glorious Democratic People's Republic of Korea. To mark the 70th anniversary of their state with splendour is of real significance for the great people, who have raised with dignity the status of their socialist country, the greatest patriotic legacy of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, to that of a strategic state recognized by the world. We should make constant innovations and continued progress until we win the final victory of the revolution by carrying on the tradition of heroic struggle and collective innovation which adorned the founding and course of development of Juche Korea. A revolutionary general offensive should be launched to achieve fresh victory on all fronts of building a powerful socialist country by taking the historic victory in the building of the DPRK's nuclear forces as a springboard for fresh progress. ""Let us launch a revolutionary general offensive to achieve fresh victory on all fronts of building a powerful socialist country!""‒this is the revolutionary slogan we should uphold. All officials, Party members and other working people should launch an all-people general offensive to frustrate the challenges of the hostile forces who are making last-ditch efforts and raise the overall strength of our Republic to a new stage of development as they brought about a great upsurge in socialist construction overcoming all difficulties through the great Chollima upswing after the war. A breakthrough should be made in reenergizing the overall economic front this year, the third year of implementing the five-year strategy for national economic development. The central task facing socialist economic construction this year is to enhance the independence and Juche character of the national economy and improve the people's standard of living as required by the revolutionary counterstrategy put forward by the Second Plenary Meeting of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party. We should concentrate all efforts on consolidating the independence and Juche character of the national economy. The electric-power industry should maintain and reinforce the self-supporting power generation bases, and direct a great deal of efforts to developing new power sources. A dynamic campaign should be conducted to drastically increase thermal power generation, and lower the loss of electric power and increase its production as much as possible by maintaining and reinforcing imperfect generating facilitates. Provinces should build power generation bases to suit their local features and put power generation at the existing medium and small-sized power stations on a normal footing to satisfy the needs of electric power for local industry by themselves. Alternated production should be organized scrupulously throughout the country, and a vigorous struggle waged against the practices of wasting electric power to make effective use of generated electric power. The metallurgical industry should further improve the Juche-oriented iron- and steel-making technologies, increase the iron production capacity and drastically raise the quality of metallic materials in order to satisfy the needs of the national economy for iron and steel. It is necessary to ensure a preferential, planned and timely supply of electricity, concentrated iron ore, anthracite, lignite, freight wagons, locomotives and funds for the metallurgical industry. By doing so, we can fulfil next year's iron and steel production plans and make the industry Juche-oriented without fail. The chemical industry should step up the establishment of the C1 chemical industry, push the projects for catalyst production base and phosphatic fertilizer factory as scheduled, and renovate and perfect the sodium carbonate production line whose starting material is glauberite. The machine-building industry should modernize the Kumsong Tractor Factory, Sungni Motor Complex and other factories to develop and produce world-level machinery in our style. The coal and mineral production and rail transport sectors should make concerted efforts to make the country's self-reliant economic foundations prove their effectiveness. Notably, the rail transport sector should make the best use of the existing transport capacity by making transport organization and control more scientific and rational, and maintain discipline and order in the railways as rigid as in the army, so as to ensure an accident-free, on-schedule rail traffic. A turn should be brought about this year in improving the people's standard of living. Light-industry factories need to transform their equipment and production lines into labour- and electricity-saving ones and produce and supply more diversified and quality consumer goods with domestic raw and other materials, and provinces, cities and counties should develop the local economy in a characteristic way by relying on their own raw material resources. The agricultural and fishing fronts should effect an upswing. We should introduce seeds of superior strains, high-yield farming methods and high-performance farm machines on an extensive scale, do farming scientifically and technologically so as to fulfil the cereals production plan without fail, and boost the production of livestock products, fruits, greenhouse vegetables and mushrooms. We should enhance our ship building and repair capacities, launch scientific fishing campaigns, and reenergize aquatic farming. This year the service personnel and people should join efforts to complete the construction of the Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist area in the shortest period of time, push ahead with major construction projects including the renovation of Samjiyon County, the construction of the Tanchon Power Station and the second-stage waterway project of South Hwanghae Province, and channel steady efforts into the construction of houses. Building on the success we achieved in the forest restoration campaign, we should properly protect and manage the forests that have already been created, improve the technical conditions of roads, conduct river improvement on a regular basis, and protect environment in a scientific and responsible manner. Every sector and every unit of the national economy should enlist their own technical forces and economic potential to the maximum and launch a dynamic struggle to increase production and practise economy, so as to create a greater amount of material wealth. A shortcut to developing the self-sufficient economy is to give precedence to science and technology and make innovations in economic planning and guidance. The scientific research sector should solve on a preferential basis the scientific and technological problems arising in establishing Juche-oriented production lines of our own style, ensuring domestic production of raw and other materials and equipment, and perfecting the structure of the self-supporting economy. Every sector and every unit of the national economy should make a contribution to achieving production growth by intensifying the dissemination of science and technology and waging a brisk technological innovation drive. The Cabinet and other economic guidance organs should work out a realistic operational plan to carry out the national economic plan for this year and push forward the work for its implementation responsibly and persistently. Positive measures should be taken by the state to ensure that the socialist system of responsible business operation proves its worth in factories, enterprises and cooperative organizations. Socialist culture should be developed in a comprehensive way. It is necessary to strengthen the ranks of teachers, improve the contents and methods of education as demanded by the trend of developing modern education, apply the people-oriented character in public health service in a thoroughgoing way, and boost the production of medical equipment and appliances and different kinds of medicines. We should conduct mass-based sporting activities briskly, create sporting techniques and tactics of our own style, and produce artistic and literary masterpieces which truthfully depict the heroic struggle and life of our service personnel and people in the Mallima era and the beautiful and sublime features proper to human beings. In this way, we can crush the bourgeois reactionary culture by dint of our revolutionary socialist art and literature. A vigorous struggle should be waged to tighten moral discipline throughout society, establish a socialist way of life and eliminate all kinds of non-socialist practices, so as to ensure that all the people, possessed of ennobling mental and moral traits, lead a revolutionary and cultured life. The self-reliant defence capability should be further consolidated. In this year of the 70th anniversary of the development of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army into a regular revolutionary armed force by the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung, the People's Army should perfect its features as befits the revolutionary armed forces of the Party. It should organize and conduct combat training in a highly intensive way, in a real-war atmosphere, to develop all its units in different arms, services and corps into the ranks of a-match-for-a-hundred combatants. The Korean People's Internal Security Forces should sharpen the edge of the sword of the class struggle and detect and frustrate the schemes by undesirable and hostile elements in time. The Worker-Peasant Red Guards and Young Red Guards should enhance their combat capability in all aspects through intensive combat and political training. By consistently holding fast to the line of simultaneously promoting the two fronts in accordance with the strategic policy set by the Party at the Eighth Conference of Munitions Industry, the defence industry should develop and manufacture powerful strategic weapons and military hardware of our style, perfect its Juche-oriented production structure and modernize its production lines on the basis of cutting-edge science and technology. The nuclear weapons research sector and the rocket industry should mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles, the power and reliability of which have already been proved to the full, to give a spur to the efforts for deploying them for action. And we should always be ready for immediate nuclear counterattack to cope with the enemy's manoeuvres for a nuclear war. The political and ideological might is the first and foremost strength of our state and the great propellant for opening up an avenue for building a powerful socialist country. In order to successfully carry out the fighting tasks facing us, we should rally the whole Party more firmly on its organizational and ideological basis and establish a thoroughgoing revolutionary climate within the Party. In this way, we can constantly enhance its fighting efficiency and leadership role in the overall revolution and construction. All Party organizations should never tolerate all shades of heterogeneous ideas and double standards of discipline that run counter to the Party's ideology, but strengthen the single-hearted unity of the whole Party centred on its Central Committee in every way possible. The whole Party should launch an intense struggle to establish a revolutionary climate within the Party with the main emphasis put on rooting out the abuse of Party authority, bureaucratism and other outdated methods and style of work, so as to ensure that the ties of kinship between the Party and the masses of the people are as solid as a rock. Party organizations should intensify Party guidance to ensure that the work of their respective sectors and units is always conducted in conformity with the ideas and intentions of the Party and the requirements of its policies, and find satisfactory solutions to the problems arising in the building of a powerful socialist country by giving definite precedence to political work and motivating the people ideologically. We should rally all the service personnel and people firmly behind the Party ideologically and volitionally so that they throw in their lot with it whatever the adversity and fight with devotion for the victory of the socialist cause. Party and working people's organizations and government organs should orient and subordinate all their undertakings to strengthening the single-hearted unity. The benchmark in planning and launching their work should be the people's demands and interests. And they should go deep among the people, sharing good times and bad with them and solving their mental agony and difficulties in their lives. They should ensure that the shorter the supply of everything is, the fuller play is given to the beautiful traits of comrades and neighbours helping and caring for one another with all sincerity. We should give free rein to the indomitable mental strength of the heroic Korean people on the present grand Mallima march. Party and working people's organizations should ensure that all the working people cherish patriotism in their hearts and bring about collective innovations one after another in the great campaign to create the Mallima speed with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and science and technology as the dynamic force. They should see to it that officials, Party members and other working people carry forward the fighting spirit displayed by the elder generations who brought about epochal changes on the grand Chollima march and all of them become Mallima pioneers who vigorously rush forward in the vanguard of the era. Comrades, Last year, too, our people made strenuous efforts to defend the peace of the country and hasten national reunification in keeping with the aspirations and demands of the nation. However, owing to the vicious sanctions and pressure by the United States and its vassal forces and their desperate manoeuvres to ignite a war, all aimed at checking the reinforcement of the self-defensive nuclear deterrent by our Republic, the situation on the Korean peninsula became aggravated as never before, and greater difficulties and obstacles were put on the road of the country's reunification. Even though the conservative ""regime"" in south Korea, which had resorted to fascist rule and confrontation with fellow countrymen, collapsed and the ruling circles were replaced by another thanks to the massive resistance by the enraged people of all walks of life, nothing has been changed in the relations between the north and the south. On the contrary, the south Korean authorities, siding with the United States in its hostile policy towards the DPRK against the aspirations of all the fellow countrymen for national reunification, drove the situation to a tight corner, further aggravated the mistrust and confrontation between the north and the south, and brought the bilateral relations to a fix that can be hardly resolved. We can never escape the holocaust of a nuclear war forced by the outside forces, let alone achieve national reunification, unless we put an end to this abnormal situation. The prevailing situation demands that now the north and the south improve the relations between themselves and take decisive measures for achieving a breakthrough for independent reunification without being obsessed by bygone days. No one can present an honourable appearance in front of the nation if he or she ignores the urgent demands of the times. This year is significant both for the north and the south as in the north the people will greet the 70th founding anniversary of their Republic as a great, auspicious event and in the south the Winter Olympic Games will take place. In order to not only celebrate these great national events in a splendid manner but also demonstrate the dignity and spirit of the nation at home and abroad, we should improve the frozen inter-Korean relations and glorify this meaningful year as an eventful one noteworthy in the history of the nation. First of all, we should work together to ease the acute military tension between the north and the south and create a peaceful environment on the Korean peninsula. As long as this unstable situation, which is neither wartime nor peacetime, persists, the north and the south cannot ensure the success of the scheduled events, nor can they sit face to face to have a sincere discussion over the issue of improving bilateral relations, nor will they advance straight ahead towards the goal of national reunification. The north and the south should desist from doing anything that might aggravate the situation, and they should make concerted efforts to defuse military tension and create a peaceful environment. The south Korean authorities should respond positively to our sincere efforts for a detente, instead of inducing the exacerbation of the situation by joining the United States in its reckless moves for a north-targeted nuclear war that threatens the destiny of the entire nation as well as peace and stability on this land. They should discontinue all the nuclear war drills they stage with outside forces, as these drills will engulf this land in flames and lead to bloodshed on our sacred territory. They should also refrain from any acts of bringing in nuclear armaments and aggressive forces from the United States. Even though the United States is wielding the nuclear stick and going wild for another war, it will not dare to invade us because we currently have a powerful nuclear deterrent. And when the north and the south are determined, they can surely prevent the outbreak of war and ease tension on the Korean peninsula. A climate favourable for national reconciliation and reunification should be established. The improvement of inter-Korean relations is a pressing matter of concern not only to the authorities but to all other Koreans, and it is a crucial task to be carried out through a concerted effort by the entire nation. The north and the south should promote bilateral contact, travel, cooperation and exchange on a broad scale to remove mutual misunderstanding and distrust, and fulfil their responsibility and role as the motive force of national reunification. We will open our doors to anyone from south Korea, including the ruling party and opposition parties, organizations and individual personages of all backgrounds, for dialogue, contact and travel, if they sincerely wish national concord and unity. A definite end should be put to the acts that might offend the other party and incite discord and hostility between fellow countrymen. The south Korean authorities should not try, as the previous conservative ""regime"" did, to block contact and travel by people of different social strata and suppress the atmosphere for reunification through alliance with the north, under absurd pretexts and by invoking legal and institutional mechanisms; instead, they should direct efforts to creating conditions and environment conducive to national concord and unity. To improve inter-Korean relations as soon as possible, the authorities of the north and the south should raise the banner of national independence higher than ever before, and fulfil their responsibility and role they have assumed for the times and the nation. Inter-Korean relations are, to all intents and purposes, an internal matter of our nation, which the north and the south should resolve on their own responsibility. Therefore, they should acquire a steadfast stand and viewpoint that they will resolve all the issues arising in bilateral relations on the principle of By Our Nation Itself. The south Korean authorities need to know that they will gain nothing from touring foreign countries to solicit their help on the issue of inter-Korean relations, and that such behaviour will give the outside forces, who pursue dishonest objectives, an excuse for their interference and complicate matters further. Now it is not time for the north and the south to turn their backs on each other and merely express their respective standpoints; it is time that they sit face to face with a view to holding sincere discussions over the issue of improving inter-Korean relations by our nation itself and seek a way out for its settlement in a bold manner. As for the Winter Olympic Games to be held soon in south Korea, it will serve as a good occasion for demonstrating our nation's prestige and we earnestly wish the Olympic Games a success. From this point of view we are willing to dispatch our delegation and adopt other necessary measures; with regard to this matter, the authorities of the north and the south may meet together soon. Since we are compatriots of the same blood as south Koreans, it is natural for us to share their pleasure over the auspicious event and help them. We will, in the future, too, resolve all issues by the efforts of our nation itself under the unfurled banner of national independence and frustrate the schemes by anti-reunification forces within and without on the strength of national unity, thereby opening up a new history of national reunification. Availing myself of this opportunity, I extend warm New Year greetings once again to all Korean compatriots at home and abroad, and I sincerely wish that in this significant year everything would go well both in the north and in the south. Comrades, The international situation we witnessed last year was clear proof that our Party and our state were absolutely correct in their strategic judgement and decision that when we are confronting the imperialist forces of aggression who are attempting to wreck global peace and security and make mankind suffer a nuclear holocaust, our only recourse is the power of justice. As a responsible, peace-loving nuclear power, our country will neither have recourse to nuclear weapons unless hostile forces of aggression violate its sovereignty and interests nor threaten any other country or region by means of nuclear weapons. However, it will resolutely respond to acts of wrecking peace and security on the Korean peninsula. Our Party and the government of our Republic will develop good-neighbourly and friendly relations with all the countries that respect our national sovereignty and are friendly to us, and make positive efforts to build a just and peaceful new world. Comrades, The year 2018 will be recorded as another year of victory for our people. At this moment when this year's gigantic march has begun, I am filled with confidence that our cause is ever-victorious as it is supported by the people, and I harden my resolve to make devoted efforts to live up to their expectations. The Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the Republic will never cease to struggle and advance until achieving the final victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche by relying on the trust and strength of the people, but surely hasten the future of a powerful socialist country where all the people lead a dignified and happy life. Let us all march forward dynamically towards fresh victory of the revolution by displaying the unyielding mettle of heroic Korea under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea.",fellow countryman

09.02.2018,Kim Jong-un,"Officers and men of the heroic Korean People's Army, Commanders and combatants of the units participating in the parade to be held in celebration of the 70th founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army, Dear Pyongyang citizens and other people across the country, Today, marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army, revolutionary regular armed forces, by the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung, we are holding a grand parade of the combat units of the Korean People's Army. The first parade of the regular armed forces held 70 years ago in the square in front of the Pyongyang Railway Station demonstrated the proud image of the newly-emergent Korea, and today's military parade will demonstrate the mettle of the powerful Democratic People's Republic of Korea which has developed into a world-class military power. Availing myself of this opportunity when we are looking back with deep emotion on the proud militant course of history of the heroic Korean People's Army, and reflecting the great emotion overflowing in the hearts of all our service personnel and people, I would like to extend noblest respect and infinite glory to the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, who founded and built up the Juche-oriented revolutionary armed forces. I also would like to extend noble respect to the fighters of the anti-Japanese revolution and soldiers of the People's Army who fought with revolutionary arms in their hands, dedicating their youth and even lives without hesitation to the reunification and sovereignty of their country, to the liberation of their fellow people and to socialist construction, and greeting the army founding day, I offer my warm congratulations and militant salute to the war veterans, discharged soldiers and all the officers and men of the army. My heartfelt thanks go to the working class, agricultural working people and other people across the country, who readily placed their sons and daughters, whom they had brought up with great care, at the posts of national defence, and have provided on a top priority basis, even in the face of difficulties and trials, everything needed for increasing the combat capabilities of the army. Comrades, Together with April 25, when Comrade Kim Il Sung founded the Korean People's Revolutionary Army, February 8, when he founded the Korean People's Army, revolutionary regular armed forces, is a day of historic significance in building up the revolutionary armed forces and accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche. Our people, who had to experience the miserable fate of a ruined nation for lack of an army worth mentioning, ardently desired for a powerful army of their own. This centuries-old desire of our people was achieved 70 years ago this February 8 under the wise leadership of the great Comrade Kim Il Sung. After the country's liberation the great Comrade Kim Il Sung set the founding of a powerful regular army as a prerequisite for developing the country into an independent and sovereign state. He stepped up the cause of army building by dint of his outstanding ideas and energetic leadership, thereby founding the Korean People's Army, the revolutionary regular armed forces of the Juche type, in a matter of less than three years. The Korean People's Army is, both in name and in reality, a revolutionary army that inherited the traditions of the anti-Japanese struggle?the indomitable revolutionary spirit of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army and its rich fighting experience and adroit art of warfare. Thanks to the birth of this Juche-oriented regular army our Republic, from the very beginning after its founding, enjoyed the prestige of being a dignified people's country with its own strong armed forces; it defeated the imperialist aggressor forces that had been boasting of being the ""mightiest"" in the world and achieved a great victory in the Fatherland Liberation War. April 25, 1932, the day when our revolutionary armed forces began to take historical roots, was fundamental to vanquishing the brigandish Japanese imperialists and realizing the sacred cause of national liberation; February 8, 1948, the birthday of our regular armed forces that inherited the traditions of the anti-Japanese struggle, was crucial to the great victory of the Fatherland Liberation War and the successful advance of our socialist cause. The whole course of historic development of the Korean People's Army has been accompanied by constant tension and intense confrontation in the world's largest powder-keg and hottest spot which is pregnant with the danger of outbreak of a war. Being faithful to its mission of defending the country, the revolution and the people, our army has smashed the enemy's adventurous provocations at every step, upholding the military line of self-reliant defence and the banner of ""a-match-for-a-hundred."" In the course of this, it has been developed into an invincible combat force capable of defeating any enemy, however formidable, at a stroke. In the grimmest and most difficult period when it had to fight against the allied imperialist forces of the world single-handed, with no flanks and with no support from outside, our People's Army performed remarkable exploits by waging a heroic, do-or-die struggle in the first line of the revolution under the leadership of the great Comrade Kim Jong Il. As this elite revolutionary army played the role of the standard-bearer and solid cornerstone for defending socialism and the revolution at the forefront of the anti-imperialist military front and the construction of a prosperous country, our Republic has won one brilliant victory after another in the battle to safeguard socialism and gained the high reputation of a world-class military power. In world history cannot be found any other nation that accomplished the great cause of army building from scratch by relying on its internal forces and built an elite army in spite of the protracted, worst-ever challenges and blockade; such brilliant exploit of building a powerful army for the sake of national prosperity is a miracle that can be wrought only by the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the peerless patriots and iron-willed commanders. Officers and men of the People's Army, The Korean People's Army, which made its first fine appearance through a magnificent parade 70 years previously, has become what it is today, hoisting the flag of victory in the fierce battle fields in defence of the country and people. Our army, which has grown up into a world-class powerful army, is a stout pillar in preventing the catastrophe of war and defending peace on the Korean peninsula and in the region and a force that makes breakthroughs in the vanguard of the grand march of our people towards final victory for the socialist cause. Now our people regard as their great pride our brave People's Army which is struggling with the spirit and stamina of Paektu, and are gaining fresh strength and courage from the militant might of our army which is growing stronger day by day. The People's Army has won the sincere affection and trust of the people at the cost of blood, sweat and death-defying devotion, achieved oneness with them enjoying their enthusiastic support and assistance, and performed feats on the fronts for defending the country and building socialism. It is a source of pride for our Party and state and a great fortune of our people that they have such a dignified and powerful revolutionary army, an army of the people. I deem it the highest honour to have assumed the heavy responsibility of supreme command of the courageous revolutionary army. On behalf of the Workers' Party of Korea, the government of the Republic and all the people, I once again warmly congratulate all the officers and men on the occasion of the 70th founding anniversary of the heroic Korean People's Army, and extend militant greetings to them. Combatants of the units participating in this parade and all the other officers and men of the People's Army, As the Party and the country have high expectations of it and the people are sincere in their affection for it, the People's Army must defend the country and the people reliably through faithful service and devoted struggle as befits the army of the Party and people. The People's Army should increase its political and military capabilities to the maximum as suited to the status of our dignified state to meet the demands of the times and the developing revolution, and firmly guarantee by force of arms the struggle of our Party and people to accomplish the socialist cause. The central task facing the People's Army at present is to perfect its combat capabilities as befitting a revolutionary army by holding aloft the banner of modelling the entire army on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and implementing to the letter the strategic lines and tasks for increasing the military strength put forward by the Party. The People's Army should be boundlessly loyal to the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea. The Korean People's Army is the army of our Party which was born and built up in the embrace of the Party; the source of its mightiness lies in the Party's revolutionary ideas and leadership. It should become the first death-defying corps, the first guards unit, sharing its destiny with the Workers' Party of Korea and defending its Central Committee with arms. It should firmly establish the unified leadership system of the Party within itself, create a revolutionary military climate in which all its service personnel move as one under the command of the Party, and organize and conduct all types of military work on the basis of the Party's lines and policies. It should maintain strengthening itself politically and ideologically and making itself morally sound as its two major tasks, and concentrate all its efforts on preparing itself as an army that is strong in ideology and faith like the 7th Regiment during the anti-Japanese war and the Guards units during the Fatherland Liberation War. It should raise more fiercely the flames of the revolution in training to improve its capability of fighting a war. Training is precisely the way to defending the socialist country and the people, and the short-cut to turning the People's Army into a powerful army is to make the most exacting demand upon its soldiers under training. It should steadily improve the content, style and method of training in line with the Party's ideas on military strategy and tactics, with the demands of the Juche-oriented tactics and with the demands and features of modern warfare, and should not stop even a day practical training in a virtual combat environment. In the present situation, in which the United States and its vassal forces are making a fuss around the Korean peninsula, the People's Army should remain on full alert and give a spur to perfecting its combat preparedness. Thus we must prevent any aggressive forces from violating or offending the dignity and sovereignty of our sacred country in the slightest. Units of all services, arms and corps must intensify training aimed at having a command of their military hardware and improving their specialist levels, so as to make full preparations for waging hi-tech warfare in any operational space. In particular, the People's Army must present building itself up into an army, which is excellent in all aspects, as an important strategic task in line with the requirements of the new, higher stage of turning the entire army into an army of cadres and modernizing it, and give top priority to its implementation. The People's Army must establish rigid ethos and assume the appearance of a perfect regular army. All the service personnel, from privates to generals, should be well versed in military regulations and manuals, and make it part of their habit to abide by them, thus ensuring that all units, sub-units and other places where there are soldiers always present regularized features. All the officers and men of the army, always bearing in mind that the People's Army cannot exist even a moment separated from the people, must boundlessly respect and love them, and constantly sustain the fine traits of the revolutionary army, whose soldiers defy death if it is for the sake of the people. The People's Army must not weigh the importance of undertakings intended for the people, but regard it as a revolutionary military climate to devote all its sincerity with the most honest attitude. Holding higher the patriotic, revolutionary slogan ""Let us take upon ourselves both national defence and socialist construction,"" it should give free rein to its unexcelled heroism in all places for translating the people's dreams and ideals into reality by displaying fortitude and creativity, not knowing the word impossible, and continuously take the lead in the struggle for transforming the country into a more beautiful land. Comrades, As long as imperialism exists on the globe and the United States persists in following its hostile policy against our country, the mission of the People's Army, as a powerful sword for defending the country, people and peace, can never be changed. Final victory belongs to our Party and people with a firm grip on the arms of the revolution. Our Party and people are fully convinced that the Korean People's Army, which has provided a military guarantee for the revolutionary cause of Juche, will continue to reliably defend the Party and the revolution, the country and the people, and increase its strength in every way possible to safeguard justice and peace. As long as we have the Korean People's Army that is unfailingly loyal to the leadership of the Workers’ Party of Korea, our glorious motherland?the Democratic People's Republic of Korea?will grow more powerful and more prosperous. All the service personnel of the People's Army, The flag of the ever-victorious Workers' Party of Korea will always lead the way ahead of you, giving you a great encouragement and rousing you to fresh struggle and victory. Let us fight bravely for the Party and the revolution, the country and the people.",officer man heroic army commander combatant unit participate parade hold celebration found anniversary army

28.03.2018,Kim Jong-un,"Esteemed Comrade General Secretary Xi Jinping, Esteemed Mme Peng Liyuan, Dear Chinese comrades, In the midst of the new situation on the Korean peninsula, which is changing as never before, we are now on a lightning visit to the People's Republic of China with a desire to remain true to the long-standing, historic traditions of great friendship and revolutionary obligation between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the PRC and to inherit and develop the bilateral relations in a wonderful way down through the generations. First of all, I would like to extend heartfelt thanks to esteemed Comrade General Secretary Xi Jinping, as well as Mme Peng Liyuan, who has managed to find time despite the demanding duties of leading the Party and state and is according a warm welcome to us like his own brothers and sisters. I have been deeply impressed by the sincerity and solicitude shown by Comrade Xi Jinping and other leading Party and state cadres of China in accepting the proposal for our lightning visit with pleasure and in ensuring a success of our short visit, and I feel very grateful for this. Availing myself of this meaningful opportunity, I extend warm congratulations on the successful conclusion of the two major meetings following the grand 19th Congress of the Communist Party of China and the election of Comrade Xi Jinping as president of the PRC and chairman of the Central Military Commission of the PRC. I also tender warm greetings of members of the Workers' Party of Korea and other Korean people to members of the CPC and other Chinese people. Dear Chinese comrades, This is my first visit to China. That the first place of my foreign visit is the capital city of the PRC is too natural for me, and it is an expression of my ennobling obligation to prize the DPRK-PRC friendship like my life itself and carry it forward. I deem it a high honour to visit my country's great neighbour, and this visit has given me another opportunity to comprehend the preciousness of the DPRK-PRC friendship, a priceless legacy left by the preceding leaders of the two countries and a treasure common to the two peoples. For long years the Korean and Chinese peoples supported and cooperated closely with each other, shedding blood and dedicating their lives to the joint struggle. Real life has taught them that their destinies are inseparable. They are now clearly aware that for the two brotherly neighbours with rivers in between, peaceful environment and stability in the region are critical, and it is costly to secure and defend them. General Secretary Xi Jinping and I have just exchanged in-depth opinions on such important issues as the promotion of bilateral friendship and coordination of the pressing problems concerning the situation on the Korean peninsula, reaffirming our common commitment to consolidate the socialist systems of the two countries and ensure wellbeing and a bright future for the two peoples. It is the steadfast stand of the WPK and the government of the DPRK to develop, true to the ennobling intentions of the preceding leaders, the friendly relationship between the two countries at a new, higher level, the relationship which was established through the sacred joint struggle for the cause of socialism and retained its original features even in the whirlwind of history. Comrades, Thanks to the leadership of the CPC with General Secretary Xi Jinping as the core, the Chinese people are achieving brilliant successes in accomplishing their cause of building a modernized socialist power in the new era, and their country is enjoying ever-improving international prestige. The WPK and the Korean people feel very pleased with this as if it is their own. We sincerely wish that the Chinese people will achieve great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation under the wise leadership of General Secretary Xi Jinping by fully implementing the tasks put forward by the 19th Congress of the CPC. Last, with the belief that my meaningful first meeting with General Secretary Xi Jinping in this spring, full of joy and hope, will constitute a significant occasion in bringing rich fruition in the development of friendly relations between the two countries, I propose a toast, To the development of the great CPC and the prosperity of the PRC, To the good health and happiness of respected General Secretary Xi Jinping and Mme Peng Liyuan, and To the good health of all other comrades present here",esteemed general secretary jinping esteemed mme peng liyuan chinese comrade midst new situation peninsula change never before now lightning visit republic china desire remain true long stand historic tradition friendship revolutionary obligation democratic republic korea prc inherit bilateral relation wonderful down generation first extend heartfelt thank esteemed general secretary jinping mme peng liyuan manage find despite demand duty lead party accord warm welcome own brother sister deeply impressed sincerity solicitude show jinping lead party cadre china accept proposal lightning visit pleasure ensure success short visit feel grateful avail myself meaningful opportunity extend warm congratulation successful conclusion major meeting follow grand congress communist party china election jinping prc central military commission prc tender warm greeting member worker party korea member cpc chinese chinese comrade first visit china first place foreign visit capital city prc too natural expression ennoble obligation prize dprk prc friendship life itself forward deem honour visit neighbour visit give another opportunity comprehend preciousness dprk prc friendship priceless legacy leave precede leader country treasure common people long year chinese people support cooperate closely shed blood dedicate life joint struggle real life teach destiny inseparable now clearly aware brotherly neighbour river peaceful environment stability region critical costly secure defend general secretary jinping exchange depth opinion important issue promotion bilateral friendship coordination press problem concern situation peninsula reaffirm common commitment consolidate socialist system country ensure wellbeing bright future people steadfast stand wpk government dprk true ennoble intention precede leader friendly relationship country new high level relationship establish sacred joint struggle socialism retain original feature whirlwind history comrade thank leadership cpc general secretary jinping core chinese achieve brilliant success accomplish build modernized socialist power new era enjoy ever improve international prestige wpk feel pleased own sincerely wish chinese achieve rejuvenation chinese nation wise leadership general secretary jinping fully implement task put forward congress cpc last belief meaningful first meeting general secretary jinping spring full joy hope constitute significant occasion bring rich fruition friendly relation country propose toast cpc prosperity prc health happiness respected general secretary jinping mme peng liyuan health comrade present here
01.01.2019,Kim Jong-un,"Dear people and service personnel of the People’s Army across the country, Dear compatriots, Dear comrades and friends, Having seen out the year 2018, in which we adorned the history of the motherland, the revolution and the nation with meaningful events leaving another indelible imprint in the history, we are seeing in the new year 2019 full of hope. As we see in the new year, I extend heartfelt greetings to all the people and service personnel who devoted their all for the cause of socialist construction sharing the same mind and pace with our Party in the eventful days of last year, and wish that homes across the country will brim with affection, hope and happiness. My warm new year greetings go also to the compatriots in the south and abroad, who shared our will in writing a new history of reconciliation, unity, peace and prosperity of the nation. I wish success in the work of heads of state and other foreign friends who are making efforts for social progress and development and global peace and justice. Comrades, The year 2018 was a historic year, in which remarkable changes took place in the internal and external situations and our socialist construction entered a new stage thanks to our Party’s line of independence and strategic decision. The Third Plenary Meeting of the Seventh Party Central Committee held in April last year constituted an occasion of pivotal significance in developing our revolution onto a new stage and continuing to speed up the advance of socialism on the basis of the great victory of the line of promoting the two fronts simultaneously. Following the road of arduous struggle with faith in certain victory of socialism, our people provided by their own efforts a sure guarantee for defending their sovereignty and achieving peace and prosperity, and became able to set out on a grand revolutionary advance to attain still higher goals for the construction of a prosperous country. Thanks to our proactive and positive efforts, a peace-oriented current was created on the Korean peninsula and the international prestige of our Republic continued to be raised, and in the midst of this we celebrated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the glorious DPRK in splendour with great dignity and self-confidence. Through the celebratory events held in September, the might of the DPRK, which achieved the ideological oneness of the whole society and the single-hearted unity of the Party and the people and which possesses a reliable self-supporting economy and self-reliant defence capabilities, and the ardent will of the heroic Korean people to fight to the end for the victory of the socialist cause were fully demonstrated in front of the eyes of the world. Last year all the people further consolidated the foundations of the self-supporting economy by turning out in the struggle for carrying out the Party’s new strategic line of concentrating all efforts on economic construction. Meaningful and valuable advances were made in the struggle for implementing the line of making the national economy Juche-oriented. The generation capacity of the Pukchang Thermal Power Complex was increased remarkably, the Kim Chaek and Hwanghae iron and steel complexes and other metallurgical works built on their successes in establishing the Juche orientation in production, and dynamic efforts were made to strengthen the independent foundations of the chemical industry. The quality of various vehicles and light-industry products that give us pleasure at sight as they were made by our efforts, technology and resources was raised to a higher level and their mass production was realized, bringing delight to our people. The working class in the coal-mining industry, in defence of the lifeline of the self-supporting economy, conducted a do-or-die campaign for production when everything was in difficulty, and the agricultural sector waged an unremitting struggle for increased cereal production, thus producing a large number of high-yielding units and farmers even in adverse weather conditions. The munitions industry, in hearty response to our Party’s militant call for concentrating all efforts on economic construction, produced a variety of farm machinery, construction equipment, cooperative products and consumer goods, thereby giving an impetus to economic development and the improvement of the people’s living standards. Last year the gigantic construction projects, geared to adding glory to the era of the Workers’ Party according to the Party’s long-term plan and operations, proceeded in a three-dimensional way and on a grand scale. This demonstrated in reality the stout mettle of socialist Korea that never flinches in the face of any adversity but achieves victory after victory by surging forward more forcefully, as well as the inexhaustible potentials of our independent economy. True to the decision of the April Plenary Meeting of the Party Central Committee on bringing about a revolutionary turn in science and education, the sector of science and technology presented valuable research findings conducive to accelerating the growth of hi-tech industries and revitalizing the national economy; the efforts to make education modern and scientific gained momentum, the teaching conditions and environment being updated at many universities, colleges, middle and primary schools across the country. The sector of art and culture produced and staged a grand mass gymnastics and artistic performance, evoking positive response from at home and abroad and vividly showing the advanced level of Juche-oriented art and its peculiar features and advantages. Comrades, Through the struggle of last year, which added a new page of proud victory to the annals of our revolution, we have been convinced once again of the validity of our own cause and the invincible strength of our state. Thanks to our people’s indomitable fight against the challenge of injustice, our state’s might of self-development has increased on a steady basis and the cause of building a powerful socialist country is progressing at a faster pace. Availing myself of this opportunity, I should like to extend my heartfelt thanks, once again, to all the people including the service personnel of the People’s Army for advancing non-stop along the road of victory indicated by the Party and thus performing feats that will shine brilliantly in the history of our country. Comrades, Having grown seasoned and powerful amid the struggle to glorify the new era of the Juche revolution, our Party and people are launching the new year march full of greater confidence and ambition. This year we are faced with the task of expanding the country’s capability of independent development to open up bright prospects for taking a step forward towards socialist construction. We have the strength and foundations to bring forward a brighter future of socialism by our own efforts, and we have also developed our own strategy and creative methods to this end. When we strive hard with an indefatigable spirit on the principle of self-reliance by adhering to the Party’s new strategic line, our country’s strength will redouble and our people’s dreams and ideals will come true. “Let us open a new road of advance for socialist construction under the uplifted banner of self-reliance!”–this is the slogan we should uphold. We should bring about a revolutionary upsurge on all fronts of socialist construction by regarding self-reliance as a treasured sword for prosperity, a spirit which has always been a banner of struggle and driving force for a leap forward in the whole course of the Korean revolution. The might of the independent socialist economy should be further strengthened. We should rely on our own technical forces and resources and the high creative spirit and revolutionary enthusiasm of all the people so as to succeed in attaining the strategic goals of national economic development and enter a new stage of growth. We should properly plan and thoroughly implement the national operations aimed at maintaining, reinforcing and reenergizing the national economy as a whole. Strategic measures should be taken to give full play to the potentials of the self-supporting economy and utilize the new elements and driving force for economic development, and the manpower and material resources of the country should be enlisted in economic construction in a cost-effective way. We should focus on the main link in the national economic work, reenergize the other links of its whole chain and promote the long-term development of the economy, so as to push forward its revitalization. The management method should be innovated to satisfactorily realize the unified guidance of the state over the overall economy and give fullest play to the voluntary enthusiasm and creative abilities of the working people. The Cabinet and other state and economic guidance organs should improve planning, pricing, and monetary and financial management in line with socialist economic law and make sure that economic levers have a positive effect on the revitalization of production and expanded reproduction in enterprises. They should adjust the structures and system of work to raise the efficiency of economic work and to make enterprises smoothly conduct their business activities. Talented personnel, science and technology are our major strategic resources and weapons with which to bring about a great leap forward in socialist construction. The state should promote talent training and sci-tech development purposefully and increase its investment in them. It is necessary to improve the quality of training talented personnel, who will shoulder the socio-economic development, by improving the teaching contents and methods in conformity with the world trend of developing education and pedagogical requirements. We should set a high goal of developing new technologies and concentrate our efforts on the research into core technologies of great practical and economic significance, so as to secure the leading force of economic growth. We should also take institutional measures so that scientific research institutes and enterprises, in close cooperation, can boost production and technological development and enhance intellectual creativity. Every sector in the national economy should give impetus to hitting the targets of the five-year strategy for national economic development. We should direct primary efforts to relieving the shortage of electricity to make a breakthrough in revitalizing the national economy. One of the most important and pressing tasks in socialist economic construction for this year is to radically increase the production of electricity. By focusing state investment on the electric-power industry to maintain and reinforce its existing foundation and making maximum and effective use of it to renovate and modernize one by one badly needed sectors and projects, we can, for the present, raise power generation to the peak year level. We should take the problem of easing the strain on electricity as an undertaking of the whole state, step up the construction of hydroelectric power stations including Orangchon and Tanchon power stations and create a capacity for generating tidal, wind and atomic power under a far-reaching plan. Provinces, cities and counties should develop and utilize in an effective way various energy sources available in their local areas. The coal-mining industry is a primary front in developing the self-supporting economy. Only when coal is mass-produced can we resolve the problem of electricity and satisfy the demand for fuel and power for different sectors of the national economy including the metallurgical industry. The coal-mining industry should channel efforts, first and foremost, into supplying coal to thermal power stations so that they can normalize electricity generation without letup. The whole country should render active ideological and spiritual, material and technical assistance to coal mines, and the state should take stringent steps to provide in a responsible manner facilities and materials needed for coal production and good living conditions for coal miners. A greater development should be achieved in establishing the Juche orientation in the metallurgical and chemical industries, the two pillars in economic construction. The metallurgical industry should lower production cost to the minimum by perfecting the scientific and technological aspects of the Juche-oriented iron- and steel-making processes and ensuring their normal operation, and work out and implement an operations plan for providing them with full amounts of iron ore, refractories and ferro-alloys to meet their increased production capacity. The chemical industry should step up the building of the phosphatic fertilizer factory and the establishment of the C1 chemical industry, develop the glauberite and synthetic fibre industries and convert the existing equipment and technical processes into energy-saving and labour-saving ones. This year a nationwide effort should be made to run the chemical fertilizer factories at full capacity and boost production at the February 8 Vinalon Complex. Rail and other transport sectors should launch an intensive campaign to strengthen discipline and increase their carriage and traffic capacities to ease the strain on transport. The machine-building industry should upgrade designing and processing techniques to develop and produce a variety of modern machinery and equipment in our own way to suit our actual conditions. Improving the people’s standard of living radically is a matter of greatest importance for our Party and state. The agricultural front, the major point of attack in socialist economic construction, should conduct a campaign for increased production. The Cabinet and other relevant sectors should give effective scientific and technical guidance for each farming process and supply sufficient amounts of materials needed for this year’s farming, thus increasing cereal production decisively. They should respect the opinions and interests of farmers, masters of farming, and meet the demands of the socialist principle of distribution properly. It is necessary to adhere to the four key factors set forth by the Party for the development of livestock farming, modernize and reenergize stockbreeding bases like chicken farms, and encourage the joint stockbreeding by cooperative farms and the sideline stockbreeding by individual farmers so as to supply the people with more meat and eggs. The fishing sector should consolidate its material and technical foundations, put fishing and aquatic culture on a scientific basis and protect and increase aquatic resources, so as to open a new path for developing the fishing industry. The sector of light industry, by consistently upholding the banner of modernizing production lines, obtaining at home everything needed for production and improving quality, should produce and supply various kinds of consumer goods that are favoured by the people, and ensure that provinces, cities and counties renovate the condiments factories and other locally-run plants and maintain their regular operation by relying on the locally available raw materials and other resources. This year, too, we should push ahead, in a bold manner, with huge construction projects for national prosperity and the people’s wellbeing. The whole Party, the entire army and all the people should turn out to transform Samjiyon County into a model of modern mountainous city, an ideal socialist village, and complete on the highest possible level the construction projects that would represent the present era, including the Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist area and other new tourist areas. It is important to steadily improve architectural designing and construction methods, and ensure domestic production and better quality of finishing materials, so as to build all the architectural structures magnificently and in our own style and provide our people with a cultured, happy life. With the national-level construction projects underway on an extensive scale, we should build up the capacity of producing cement and other building materials as planned. We should make proactive efforts to implement the tasks for the second stage of the forest restoration campaign, improve landscaping, urban management and road administration, and take every precaution against environmental pollution. All sectors and all units should fulfil their quotas of the national economic plan in all its indices by identifying and enlisting every last reserve, possibility and potential and by increasing production and practising economy. The politico-ideological strength of our socialist state should be increased in every way possible. It is necessary to unite the broad sections of the masses solidly around the Party by thoroughly applying the Juche-oriented view on the people, a people-oriented philosophy, in Party and state activities. Party and government organs and working people’s organizations should give top and absolute priority to the people’s interests whatever they plan and whatever they conduct; they should lend an ear to their sincere opinions, prioritize their wants and anything beneficial to them, and strive to translate them into reality without any conditions attached. Anywhere, anytime and under any circumstances, they should make selfless, devoted efforts for the good of the people, direct primary attention to their livelihood, and ensure that everybody benefits from the politics of affection and trust, the one of embracing and taking care of them all. They should intensify the struggle to eradicate both serious and trivial instances of abuse of power, bureaucratism and corruption, which would wreak havoc on the harmonious whole of the Party and the masses and undermine the socialist system. However the situation and circumstances may change, Party members and all other working people should cherish the principle of our state first as an element of their faith and step up socialist economic construction in our own way. They should glorify the country’s great history by working with sincere devotion and a patriotic desire for developing their homeland by their own efforts before the eyes of the world, the precious land of socialism which they have defended from generation to generation. We should accelerate the building of socialist civilization. A revolutionary habit of studying and a way of cultural and emotional life should be established throughout society, so that all the people possess versatile knowledge and cultural attainments as required by the developing times. The sector of art and literature should create splendid works including films and songs that reflect the times and reality and touch the people’s heartstrings, thus enriching the spiritual and cultural wealth of the nation and giving a powerful impetus to today’s grand revolutionary march. We should ensure that all the people realize the advantages of the socialist public health system by modernizing pharmaceutical and medical appliance factories, upgrading medical institutions and raising the level of medical service. Mass-based sporting activities should be conducted briskly and specialized sporting techniques developed to ensure that the whole country brims over with vigour and optimism and the sportspeople continue to demonstrate the wisdom and might of Koreans in international competitions. We should launch a powerful drive to establish a socialist way of life and ennobling moral discipline, thus ensuring that no immoral and uncultured practices that run counter to our people’s emotions and aesthetic view are revealed. By doing so, we can turn the whole society into a large, harmonious family filled with moral excellence and tender feelings. The national defence capability should be solidified. The People’s Army should reliably defend the Party and revolution and the security of the country and the people and continuously perform miraculous feats at all sites of socialist construction as in the past by consistently holding fast to the four-point policy for developing it into a powerful army. By doing so, it should demonstrate to the full the might of the revolutionary army, the invincible might of the army of our Party. The Korean People’s Internal Security Forces, as befitting the red shield of the revolution, should defend unto death our Party, system and people, and the Worker-Peasant Red Guards should effect a turn in strengthening its combat efficiency in this year of its 60th founding anniversary. Powerful self-defence capacity is a cornerstone of the existence of a state and a guarantee for safeguarding peace. The munitions industry should, on the one hand, steadily raise the national defence capacity to that of the world’s advanced countries by stepping up the effort for making the defence industry Juche-based and modern, therefore guaranteeing the peace on the Korean peninsula by force of arms, and, on the other, should actively support economic construction. In order to successfully carry out the militant tasks facing us this year, officials, leading members of the revolution, should make redoubled efforts and struggle with determination and courage. It is none other than the masses of the people that constitute the motive force and are responsible for carrying out Party policy, and they know actual conditions better than anybody else. Officials should always immerse themselves in the pulsating reality, seeing everything with their own eyes and conducting a comprehensive analysis of how matters stand; they should go deep among the masses, sharing board and lodging with them and motivating them to resolve bottlenecks if any. They should set their ideals and ambitions in keeping with the Party’s plans, and steadily improve their practical abilities and widen their horizon; in this way they should become competent organizers and hands-on workers who make persistent efforts to achieve everything perfectly at the standard demanded by the Party. They should throw themselves into doing any challenging task, burn the midnight oil pondering on how to bring benefit to the country and people, and find the worth of their work in the people’s happy laughter. Today young people should play a large part in promoting socialist construction. With the same spirit and mettle which they displayed in recent years to create legendary tales of the new era in response to the Party’s militant appeal, they should honour their title of vanguard at the revolutionary posts where the Party wants them to be. In the present stirring era they should become pioneers of new technology, creators of new culture and pathfinders for a great leap forward; they should make sure that youthful vigour and stamina are overflowing wherever they work. It is needed to decisively increase the role of Party organizations. Party organizations at all levels should conduct political and ideological work in a progressive manner in line with the requirements of the times and the developing revolution in order to make our people give full play to the strength of their indomitable spirit on all fronts of socialist construction. They should give a boost to administrative and economic officials so that they can map out plans and provide guidance for implementing Party policy in a responsible way, and fire a zeal for collective innovation and competition in their sectors and units. Provincial, city and county Party committees should wage a powerful struggle to bring about a turn in the development of farming, education and local industries. Comrades, Last year was a stirring year which witnessed a dramatic change unprecedented in the history of national division spanning over 70 years. With a determination to usher in an era of national reconciliation, peace and prosperity by putting an end to the abnormal state on the Korean peninsula which had suffered a constant war crisis, we took proactive and bold measures to effect a great turn in north-south relations from the outset of last year. It is unprecedented that three rounds of inter-Korean summit meetings and talks were held in a year amid great expectations and interest of peoples at home and abroad, and this clearly showed that north-south relations entered a completely new stage. The Panmunjom Declaration, the September Pyongyang Joint Declaration and the north-south agreement in the military field, which were adopted by reflecting the firm resolve and will to usher in an era of peace in which war exists no longer on the Korean peninsula, are of great significance as a virtual nonaggression declaration in which north and south have committed themselves to terminating fratricidal war based on force of arms. While sportspersons of north and south displayed the wisdom and strength of the nation by jointly entering international competitions, artistes came and went to Pyongyang and Seoul to fire the enthusiasm for national reconciliation and reunification. We took the significant first step towards common prosperity of the nation by promoting cooperation projects in various fields including railways, road, forestry and public health while resolutely overcoming manifold obstacles and difficulties. The surprising changes which took place in inter-Korean relations last year convinced all the fellow countrymen that when they join minds and efforts, they can turn the Korean peninsula into the true home of the nation, which is the most peaceful and will prosper forever. Though it was the initial step, north and south pooled intentions and wisdom to surely reverse inter-Korean relations in the utmost extremes of distrust and confrontation to those of trust and reconciliation and make in a short time eye-opening achievements which were unimaginable in the past. I am very satisfied with that. In the New Year 2019 we should make greater strides in our efforts to boost inter-Korean relations, achieve peace and prosperity and reunify the country on the basis of the priceless achievements we made last year which was wonderfully adorned with unprecedented events. All the nationals should hold high the slogan “Let us usher in a heyday of peace, prosperity and reunification of the Korean peninsula by thoroughly implementing the historic north-south declarations!” It is our steadfast will to eradicate military hostility between north and south and make the Korean peninsula a durable and lasting peace zone. North and south, as they agreed, should take practical measures proactively to remove military hostility on the whole of the Korean peninsula, including the ground, airspace and sea, as a follow-up to its ending in the areas of confrontation. Given that north and south committed themselves to advancing along the road of peace and prosperity, we maintain that the joint military exercises with foreign forces, which constitute the source of aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula, should no longer be permitted and the introduction of war equipment including strategic assets from outside should completely be suspended. It is also needed to actively promote multi-party negotiations for replacing the current ceasefire on the Korean peninsula with a peace mechanism in close contact with the signatories to the armistice agreement so as to lay a lasting and substantial peace-keeping foundation. All the fellow countrymen should unite as one, being conscious that the master of peace on the peninsula is our nation, in order to wage a powerful struggle to check and frustrate all the moves that wreck peace and incite military tension on this land. Inter-Korean cooperation and exchanges should be expanded and developed in an all-round way so that national reconciliation and unity can be consolidated and all the fellow countrymen can practically benefit from improved north-south relations. For the present, we are willing to resume the Kaesong Industrial Park and Mt Kumgang tourism without any precondition and in return for nothing, in consideration of the hard conditions of businesspersons of the south side who had advanced into the Kaesong Industrial Park and the desire of southern compatriots who are eager to visit the nation’s celebrated mountain. When north and south join hands firmly and rely on the united strength of the fellow countrymen, no external sanctions and pressure, challenges and trials will be able to hinder us in our efforts to open a broad avenue to national prosperity. We will never tolerate the interference and intervention of outside forces who stand in the way of national reconciliation, unity and reunification with the design to subordinate inter-Korean relations to their tastes and interests. North and south should not pass up the favourable atmosphere of today when all the nationals’ interest in and aspiration for reunification are growing unprecedentedly, but actively try to find a peaceful reunification plan based on nationwide agreement and direct sincere efforts to this end. All the fellow countrymen in north, south and abroad should further accelerate in high spirits the nationwide advance for implementing the north-south declarations, and thus glorify this year as a historic one when another radical change is brought about in the development of inter-Korean relations and implementation of the cause of national reunification. Comrades, Last year, our Party and the government of our Republic exerted responsible efforts to safeguard the peace and security of the world and expand and strengthen friendship with different countries. The three rounds of our visit to the People’s Republic of China and the Cuban delegation’s visit to our country were remarkable events in boosting strategic communication and traditional ties of friendship and cooperation among the socialist countries. Last year, frequent visits and exchanges were made on Party, state and government levels between the DPRK and many countries of the world, with the result that they deepened mutual understanding and confirmed the stand and will to promote sound development of the international community. The historic, first-ever DPRK-US summit meeting and talks brought about a dramatic turn in the bilateral relationship which was the most hostile on the earth and made a great contribution to ensuring peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the region. It is the invariable stand of our Party and the government of our Republic and my firm will to establish a new bilateral relationship that meets the demand of the new era as clarified in the June 12 DPRK-US Joint Statement, build a lasting and durable peace regime and advance towards complete denuclearization. Accordingly, we declared at home and abroad that we would neither make and test nuclear weapons any longer nor use and proliferate them, and we have taken various practical measures. If the US responds to our proactive, prior efforts with trustworthy measures and corresponding practical actions, bilateral relations will develop wonderfully at a fast pace through the process of taking more definite and epochal measures. We have no intention to be obsessed with and keep up the unsavoury past relationship between the two countries, but are ready to fix it as early as possible and work to forge a new relationship in line with the aspirations of the two peoples and the requirements of the developing times. As evidenced by the reality of north-south relations that made rapid progress last year, nothing is impossible to a willing heart, and dialogue partners will reach the destinations that are beneficial to each other without fail if they put forward fair proposals on the principle of recognizing and respecting each other by abandoning their dogged insistence broadmindedly and conduct negotiations with a proper stand and the will to settle issues. I want to believe that our relations with the United States will bear good fruit this year, as inter-Korean relations have greeted a great turn, by the efforts of the two sides. I am of the opinion that, while meeting and holding talks beneficial to both sides with the US president in June last year, we exchanged constructive views and reached a consensus of understanding for a shortcut to removing each other’s apprehensions and resolving the entangled problems. I am ready to meet the US president again anytime, and will make efforts to obtain without fail results which can be welcomed by the international community. But if the United States does not keep the promise it made in the eyes of the world, and out of miscalculation of our people’s patience, it attempts to unilaterally enforce something upon us and persists in imposing sanctions and pressure against our Republic, we may be compelled to find a new way for defending the sovereignty of the country and the supreme interests of the state and for achieving peace and stability of the Korean peninsula. The stabilized situation on the Korean peninsula and in the region is never something that has been created with ease, and the countries that are truly desirous of peace have the common responsibility for setting great store by the current situation. The neighbouring countries and international community have to support our sincere stand and efforts for promoting the positive development of the situation on the Korean peninsula and fight against all practices and challenges that wreck peace and run counter to justice. Our Party and the government of our Republic will continue to bolster up unity and cooperation with the socialist countries and develop relations with all countries that are friendly to us under the ideals of independence, peace and friendship. Comrades, We are beginning the journey of the new year as we brace ourselves once again with the resolve to work devotedly for our country, our motherland, and the happier laughter of younger generations. What we are convinced of once again as we proudly review the past year when we made rapid progress while paving our way by our own efforts with belief in our own strength in the face of harsh economic blockade and sanctions, is the truth that our state is fully capable of dynamically advancing along the road of development of socialism of our own style by dint of our people’s great strength and efforts, without any external assistance or any other’s help. This year, too, we will face constant obstacles and challenges in our progress, but no one can change our determination and will and stop our vigorous advance and our people will successfully achieve their beautiful ideals and goals without fail. Let us all work energetically and with one mind and will for the prosperity and development of the genuine people’s country, the socialist motherland.",service personnel army across compatriot comrade

12.04.2019,Kim Jong-un,"Dear Deputies, The First Session of the 14th Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is convened at a time when the prestige and strength of our Republic advancing along the road of independence are being demonstrated to the full and its socialist construction has entered a very important period. As the election to the 14th Supreme People's Assembly was held successfully amid the high political enthusiasm of all the people and with their active participation and the government of the Republic was reorganized, our State power has been further consolidated and the revolutionary advance of our people, who, united with one mind and will around the Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the Republic, are marching confidently towards a higher goal of socialism, will be further accelerated. I extend my heartfelt thanks to all the Deputies for having placed, on behalf of all the people, great trust in me so that I would continue to lead the overall work of the State as Chairman of the State Affairs Commission of our glorious country, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; and I pledge myself to work with devotion for the development and prosperity of the Republic and the happiness of our people. Comrades, Accomplishing the socialist cause under the unfurled banner of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is a great and historic task facing the government of the Republic. Modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism is the highest programme of our Party and the government of our Republic and the general direction and general goal of the construction of a socialist State. It is only when we thoroughly apply Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism to State building and activities that we can develop our Republic into the State of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il for ever and creditably satisfy our people's demands for and ideals of independence true to the will and wishes of the great leaders. The government of our Republic will achieve decisive victory in implementing the socialist cause by conducting more vigorously the struggle for modelling the whole society on KimilsungismKimjongilism. 1 Comrades, The major fighting task facing us in our efforts for modelling the whole society on KimilsungismKimjongilism is to accomplish the cause of building a powerful socialist country. Building a powerful socialist country is a historic stage in the struggle for achieving the final victory of socialism, and this can be accomplished with credit only by applying the KimilsungistKimjongilist ideas of State building in a thoroughgoing way. The Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist ideas of State building contain in a concentrated way the ideas of, and exploits in, State building of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, who developed our Republic into the most prestigious and strong socialist State in its history; these ideas also indicate clearly the ways and means for accomplishing the socialist cause with the State government as a political weapon. With the great Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist ideas of State building as the immutable guiding principle, the government of the Republic should raise the country's strategic position and national strength onto a new high and bring about a fundamental turn in accomplishing the Juche-oriented socialist cause. The revolutionary line of independence should be carried out in State building and activities. Independence is the political philosophy of our Republic, and it constitutes the core of the Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist ideas of State building. A socialist State can defend the country's prestige and people's destiny and build and perfect socialism as suited to its situation and by its own efforts, only when it maintains the principle of independence and the Juche-oriented stand definitely in all its activities. The great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il raised independence as the life of the Korean revolution and the fundamental cornerstone for State building and advanced the revolution and construction in our own way while categorically rejecting worship of big countries, dogmatism and the high-handedness and pressure by outside forces. Under their wise leadership our Republic has been built and developed to be a socialist State, independent in politics, self-supporting in the economy and self-reliant in national defence, and it is still demonstrating to the world its prestige and might as a powerful independent country. Its strategic position and influence is being raised day by day as it recently achieved the historic cause of developing the two fronts simultaneously amid a do-or-die confrontation with the imperialists and is leading the trend of situation towards peace. Today the imperialists' wilful violation of the sovereignty of other countries is growing more undisguised than ever before, and not a few countries are being forced into a miserable plight as they have no strength with which to defend themselves; in this world it is hard to find a country like our Republic that is steadfast in the principle of independence and assures the security of the State and the happiness of the people by its own efforts. Holding fast to the revolutionary line of independence in State building and activities is a consistent and immutable stand of our Republic. Geographically, Korea is sandwiched between big countries and its territory remains divided. Our Republic is conducting socialist construction as the hostile forces are resorting to more vicious schemes in trying to contain, undermine and stifle it. On the other hand, the contradictions and confrontations among great powers in their pursuit of hegemony are worsening on a regional and worldwide scale. Given the special circumstances of our revolution and the complexity of the present world situation, our Republic should build up its own strength from the firm standpoint of independence and seek independent development to defend its sovereignty and dignity and achieve true prosperity. In the past, too, when the world socialist camp existed and the countries concerned maintained cooperative relations to varying degrees, our Republic adhered to selfdetermination and independence in carrying on the revolution and construction, and promoted socialist construction on the principle of self-reliance. Building socialism by its own efforts according to the revolutionary line of independence is the basic principle our Republic must invariably maintain in State building. Whatever wind may blow and whatever challenges and difficulties may lie ahead, our Republic will, in the future, too, make no concession or compromise over the issues concerning the fundamental interests of our State and people. It will resolve everything on the strength of selfreliance and self-development, stepping up the building of a powerful socialist country in our own way and by our own efforts. A crucial factor in applying the revolutionary line of independence to the building and activities of our State is to strengthen the motive force of our revolution and develop all fields of social life in our own way. We should consolidate the country's politico-ideological position rock-solid by fully equipping the people with the great Juche idea and the spirit of national independence and rallying them firmly behind the Party and the government of our Republic. The government will develop all realms of the economy, defence and culture from the steadfast Juche-oriented stand and in our own way, and it will never tolerate others' way, others' fashion, in the slightest. Our Republic has a bright, promising future ahead, as it is steadily developing on the strong basis of independence, self-sufficiency and self-reliant defence, with the Party and the people achieving solid unity to form the powerful motive force of the revolution. It is important to apply the people-first principle to the letter in all aspects of State activities and social life. This principle is a political ideal of regarding the masses of the people as masters of the revolution and construction, relying on them and making selfless, devoted efforts for their interests. It embodies the Juche-oriented revolutionary philosophy that the people are the most precious and powerful beings in the world; it reflects the unwavering commitment of our Party and the government of our Republic to love the people dearly and satisfy their demands and interests. The people are the roots of our socialist State and its foundation; they are responsible for developing it. All the activities of Party and government organs should be thoroughly oriented and subordinated to safeguarding and realizing the people's demands and interests and faithfully serving them-this is just the way to promote the revolution and construction with success and bring the viability and advantages of socialism into full play. Maintaining the viewpoint and attitude of prioritizing the people in the activities of the State presents itself as an important matter, in view of the fact that abuses of power, bureaucratism and other violations of their interests may appear among officials in the course of socialist construction. The impertinent practices of lording it over the people and abusing the authority vested by them will impair the prestige of socialism and its people-oriented character, and weaken the people's support for and trust in the Party and the State. They may end up threatening the very existence of our socialist system. With a view to carrying forward and holding up the ennobling ideas and intentions of the great leaders, who believed in the people as in heaven and devoted their lives to their interests, our Party defined the essence of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism, the guiding ideology of our revolution, as the people-first principle and set it as the greatest priority to apply the Juche-oriented view on the people, a people-oriented philosophy, in the activities of the Party and the State. The slogan ""Everything for the people and everything by relying on them!"" encapsulates the people-first principle maintained by our Party and the government of our Republic. In all spheres of State and social life we have given top and absolute priority to what are oriented to the people and popular among them, unsparingly investing everything for their wellbeing. Over recent years our State has implemented gigantic construction projects in a bold manner. This is not because there is a surplus of funds in the country's coffers; those projects are aimed at providing our people, who are the best in the world, with better conditions for a happy, cultured life. Our Party and the government of our Republic have resolutely declared a war against abuses of power, bureaucratism and corruption, which are infringing upon the people's interests, and waged an intensive struggle against such practices, taking it as a matter with a vital bearing on the existence of our State. In the course of the endeavour to apply the people-first principle in all the activities of the Party and the State and in all fields of social life, the Party, the State and the people have formed a community in which they share the same destiny with one another; our Republic has advanced dynamically along the orbit of its development, never flinching in the face of unprecedented trials and difficulties. As socialist construction is progressing, we should direct closer attention to applying the peoplefirst principle. Then we can double the dynamic for the advancement of our revolution and continue to demonstrate the advantages peculiar to our style of socialism, those which other countries cannot imitate. The Party and the State make selfless, devoted efforts for the good of the people, and the people support their Party and State whole-heartedly, entrusting their destiny and future entirely to the latter-these are the genuine features of our State embodying the people-first principle. The government of the Republic will invariably hold fast to the people-first principle as the core of its mainstay, and strive to hasten the bright future of socialism aspired after by the people by relying on their strength. Party leadership over the overall affairs of the State should be provided in every way possible. Party leadership is the intrinsic requirement of the building of a socialist State and lifeline of its activities. Only under the leadership of a party, the incarnation of the demands and interests of the masses, can the socialist State perform its mission as their servant with credit and properly organize and undertake unified guidance over all realms of social life and all regions and the overall socialist construction. A socialist government, not led by a revolutionary party, will lose its intrinsic nature and fall prey to the reactionaries and plotters, with the result that its people cannot escape the pitiful plight of a political orphan. Our Party is the veteran and seasoned General Staff of the revolution, which has gained rich experience and outstanding leadership skills and abilities in the course of leading the several stages of social revolution and socialist construction. What instils boundless dignity and confidence in sure victory in our people is the leadership of our Party, which is bringing about world-startling, miraculous achievements one after another while leading the gigantic campaign of creation for building a powerful socialist country amid acute confrontation with the hostile forces. Party leadership over State activities should be consistently based on political guidance, policyoriented guidance. The Party is the guiding force that provides guidelines to be followed by the socialist government and guides all State activities so that they are properly conducted; the State is the executor and performer of the Party's lines and policies. Proceeding from these interrelations between the Party and the government, our Party has shown close concern over encouraging its organizations to exercise unified control over the affairs of their sectors and units and give political and policy-oriented guidance over them in the efforts to materialize its leadership over State activities. If the Party, a political leadership body, is involved in the administrative work and resorts to technical methods, it will not only deviate from its main principle but paralyse the functions of administrative organs and impair its authority, ending up making a mess of the revolution and construction. At present, the government of our Republic is satisfactorily effecting unified leadership over the State and society by relying on the revolutionary guiding ideology and scientific strategy and tactics advanced by the Workers' Party of Korea. In the future, too, it should remain faithful to the Party's ideas and leadership, so as to perform its missions of representing the rights of the masses of the people to independence, organizing their creative abilities and activities, taking care of their lives and protecting their interests. When it strictly adheres to the ideas and principles of building a socialist State elucidated by Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism, our Republic will be built more splendidly as an independent powerful State that no one can dare provoke, a people's State in which the people's ideals are fully realized and a great State that leads the world by giving full scope to its unlimited potential for development, and the victory of the socialist cause will be brought closer. 2 Comrades, The central task facing our Republic at the present stage of the struggle to build a powerful socialist country is to solidify the material foundations of socialism by concentrating all national resources on economic construction. Economic self-sufficiency is a material guarantee and prerequisite for building an independent State. Only by relying on independent and strong economic capability, it is possible to defend the dignity of a State and increase its political and military might on a steady basis. The present political situation demands that our State hold higher the banner of self-sufficiency and self-reliance. Recently, the United States has grown fearful of the threats posed by our rapidly-developing nuclear armed force to the security of its mainland. At the negotiating table, it has made much ado about improved relations and peace; on the other hand, it is resorting to all conceivable schemes in trying to prolong the economic sanctions, with the aim of preventing us from following the path of our own choice and disarming us first to create conditions for realizing its ambition of overthrowing our social system. Now that it is raising demands that run counter to the fundamental interests of our State, as a prerequisite for lifting the above sanctions, the confrontation between our country and the United States is bound to be drawn out and the hostile forces' sanctions will persist. We have built socialism in the face of their constant sanctions, but we must neither become accustomed to this nor slacken the speed of advance of our revolution. To the forces who cannot thwart us by force, sanctions are a last resort. However, these are an intolerable challenge to us; we must never connive at or remain indifferent to them, but act resolutely to frustrate them. As we put an end to the prolonged nuclear threat by dint of nukes, we must frustrate the hostile forces' sanctions on the strength of self-sufficiency and self-reliance. We have the capabilities and foundations for independent development to revitalize the national economy and raise it to the advanced international level in the shortest possible period. The foundations of our self-supporting economy that have been laid for several decades, able scientific and technical personnel, and the creative strength of the heroic people who have made self-reliance part of their mental qualities and are brimming with patriotic enthusiasmthese constitute our valuable strategic resources. By making the most of these enormous and unlimited potentialities, we must create another legendary tale of world-startling, miraculous successes and go ahead of others by making a greater leap forward. When we adhere to the line of building an independent national economy and give full play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, we can achieve remarkable development with a strength that others can neither fathom nor imagine. The strategic policy pursued by our Party and the government of our Republic in promoting socialist economic construction is to make the national economy Juche-oriented, modern, ITbased and scientific. The independence and Juche character of the national economy should be consolidated in every way possible. We must strive hard to achieve self-sufficiency in power, fuel and raw materials, which constitute the basic guarantee for independent economic development. The electric-power industry should maintain and strengthen the existing bases to maximize the production of electricity, put power supply on a scientific and rational basis, and actively develop the hydraulic, tidal, atomic and other promising sources of energy so as to create greater generating capacity. Coal and other mines, which are in charge of the primary front for economic development, should give precedence to prospecting and tunnelling, and concentrate their efforts on realizing mechanization of extracting and transport, thus extensively increasing the production of coal, the food of industry, and minerals. The metallurgical industry should establish a new modern yet large-scale iron production system that suits our actual situation by solving the scientific and technological problems arising at the Juche-oriented iron production bases and operating them properly. The chemical industry should turn itself into a Juche-oriented, energy- and labour-saving industry that totally relies on locally available raw and other materials. By doing so, it should meet the domestic demands for fertilizer, chemical fibre, synthetic plastics and various other chemical goods. The problems of food and consumer goods, which are of decisive importance in the improvement of the people's living, should be solved in the earliest period. The agricultural sector should pay special attention to solving the problems of seed, fertilizer and water and securing the land under cultivation, introduce scientific farming methods and raise the rate of mechanization of farm work, and thus attain without fail the grain production target set by the Party. The stockbreeding bases such as chicken and pig farms should be modernly built or renovated, domestic animals be raised in a scientific way, and a mass movement be launched to raise grass-eating animals perseveringly. Also, a turn should be made in the production and processing of seafood by consolidating the material and technical foundations of the fishing industry. The light industry establishments should hold fast to recycling as one of their strategies, along with the strategy of relying on locally-available raw and other materials, step up modernization of their production lines and invest great efforts in developing new products. In this way, it should ensure that larger amounts and various kinds of quality consumer goods are supplied to the people. We should carry on grand construction projects more vigorously to provide the people with more affluent and cultured living conditions. The construction sector should make innovations in architectural designing and construction method and improve the level of technical equipment of construction units to build world-class architectural structures in a larger number. The buildingmaterials industry should build up the capacity of cement production and decisively raise the proportion of domestically-produced finishing materials. The transport sector should adopt revolutionary measures for improving rail and water transport in conformity with the actual conditions in our country and resolve the problem of passenger transport in the capital city and provincial seats in our own way. We should improve the structure of the national economy still further, develop all its branches in a harmonious way and secure the international competitive edge in the magnesia and graphite industries and other promising economic sectors. We should make proactive efforts to put the national economy on a modern and IT footing so as to transform the country's economy definitely into one that is knowledge-based. We should work out strategies and targets for developing hi-tech industries including the machine-building, electronics, information, nanotechnology and biological industries, and concentrate investment on them. Every sector should build a parent, standard factory in which science and technology are integrated with production and all production lines are made remote-controlled, intelligent and fully automated and generalize its experiences, so as to raise the overall economy to the advanced level of the world. We should develop the local economy and reenergize the external economic work. Provinces, cities and counties should build and develop the economy with their own distinctiveness by giving full scope to their natural and geographical advantages and properly sustaining their economic, technical and traditional characteristics. The State should empower the local authorities to stand on their own feet and develop by themselves, and adopt relevant practical measures. The external economic sector should conduct external economic cooperation, technical exchanges and trading activities in a multifarious, proactive and tactical way on the principle of strictly abiding by the line of building an independent national economy and in the direction of reinforcing the fields and links essential in strengthening the country's economic foundations. In order to give full play to the potentials of the self-supporting socialist economy, comprehensive measures should be taken to enlist all the human and material resources and potentialities of the country in a coordinated way and utilize the new elements and driving force for economic development. The economic work of the country should be conducted under the State's unified control and supervision, and in accordance with its strategic plan and command. We should adopt a scientific and practical strategy and phased plans for the economic development of the State and execute them without fail. The structural and work system should be adjusted so that enterprises can arrange and conduct production and management activities smoothly while fully satisfying the needs of the State's unified guidance over and strategic management of the economic work. The State's institutional and legal conditions and environment concerning economic affairs should be improved and an iron discipline be established so that the economic organs and enterprises give priority to the national interests and the promotion of the people's wellbeing and observe the law and order strictly. We should further improve planning in compliance with the essential requirements of the socialist economy and deal with pricing, monetary and financial matters-the important links in the whole chain of economic management-in accordance with the economic principles and laws and in such a way as to reap profit in reality. By so doing we can encourage the enterprises and producers to work with great interest and high enthusiasm. Measures should be taken to conduct the economic management on the basis of scientific calculation so that optimum results can be obtained. Raw and other materials, funds and manpower should be economized as much as possible and the expenditure be made cost-effective so that all the resources of the country may contribute to the development of the State to the maximum. The main force that propels a self-supporting economy is the talented personnel and science and technology. We should make it part of the national social practices to attach importance to the talented personnel and science and technology, identify and appoint the talented personnel to the appropriate posts so that they may lead production and the development of technology; and we should steadily increase State investment in the field of science and technology. We should make proper decisions on major scientific and technological tasks and projects, strategic, pivotal, profitable and economically important, and concentrate our forces and funds on them to ensure that science and technology may render decisive services to reenergizing the overall economy and developing the hi-tech industry. We should build up the political and military might of our Republic. Our political and ideological might is based on the advantages and stability of the political system of our socialist State. We should substantially provide all the people with genuine political rights and dignity and give full play to the political and ideological advantages of our system, in which the whole country, united in ideology, purpose and moral obligation, makes uninterrupted progress. The government of the Republic should regard the people's interests as the absolute standard and give the first consideration to their will and desire in formulating and carrying out its policies; in this way, we can encourage the broad sections of the working masses including workers, farmers and intellectuals to take active part in the management of the State and society as befits the genuine masters of State administration. The government should give definite precedence to the political and ideological work as required by the intrinsic nature of the socialist society, so as to train all members of society as true advocates of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and further consolidate the political and ideological unity and cohesion of our State. The government of the Republic should perfect the legal system of the State and intensify the role of law in State and social life. The laws of the Republic are powerful weapons for defending the gains of the revolution, consolidating and developing the socialist system and championing and guaranteeing the people's rights and interests. In keeping with the intensification of the revolution and construction, the laws and regulations should be subdivided and specified on the basis of the requirements of the Party's policies and in reflection of the prevailing realities so as to legislate and perfect them in a scientific way; they should be modified and supplemented in good time, so that they can reliably guarantee the administration of the people-oriented politics of the socialist State. It is necessary to thoroughly establish a habit of observing the socialist laws throughout society so that all the people respect the State laws with a noble sense of law observance and abide by them on a voluntary and obligatory basis; law-enforcement organs should enhance their role, never allow double standards of discipline in enforcing laws and strictly adhere to scientific accuracy, objectivity, impartiality and prudence in applying laws; in this way, we should turn ours into the most advantageous socialist law-governed State in which laws safeguard the people and the latter observe the former. The self-reliant defence capability is a powerful and valuable weapon for defending the sovereignty of our Republic. The peace-oriented atmosphere that has begun to be created on the Korean peninsula is not stable, and the hostile forces have not given up their attempt to invade our Republic. Always keeping in mind the iron truth that peace can be guaranteed only by powerful military strength, we should hold fast to the principle of self-reliant defence and keep building up the country's defence capability. The government of the Republic will provide, on a preferential basis and in full, the human and material resources necessary for strengthening the People's Army, arming all the people and fortifying the whole country, and steadily raise the national defence capability by putting the defence industry on a highly Juche-oriented and modern footing. Socialist culture should be developed in our own way. It is important to create a climate of giving top priority to education throughout the country and bring about a radical improvement in education in our own way so as to overtake the developed countries in the educational level. The educational sector should strengthen the ranks of teachers, improve the quality of education as demanded by the trend of developing modern education, and thus train larger numbers of talented personnel who will shoulder the scientific and technological development of the country and socialist construction. Upholding the slogan of making all the people well versed in science and technology, we should enrol all the working people in the study-while-you-work system and prepare them as intelligent workers. The government of the Republic should give special attention to the socialist health service. It should further improve medical service, raise medical science and technology to the cuttingedge standard and consolidate the material and technical foundations of the health service sector, thereby bringing greater benefits of our country's socialist healthcare system to the people. The sector of culture and arts should create larger numbers of masterpieces that represent the demands of the times and aspirations of the people, and the sector of cinematic art, in particular, should kindle the flames of effecting an upsurge in film-making in the new century, thus playing the role of pacesetter in opening up a new heyday of the development of socialist culture. Sports play a very important role in consolidating a nation's strength and exalting its resourcefulness and prestige. A nationwide effort should be directed to developing sports science and specialized sporting techniques and organizing the mass-based sports activities on a wide scale. At the same time, sports facilities should be increased in number and the existing ones renovated with an eye to satisfactorily hosting even international games. Establishing a socialist way of life and moral discipline is a severe political struggle and an acute class struggle to safeguard and add lustre to our ideology and system. We should encourage all the members of society, with a high sense of pride and self-confidence that our culture, our way of life and our morality are the best, to give full play to the collectivist way of life and moral traits and actively create and fully enjoy the revolutionary and optimistic cultured way of life of our style as suited to the aesthetic sensibilities of today that aspire after cultural development. We should firmly defend the ideological and cultural position of our State by strictly guarding against any slightest expression of immoral and alien phenomena that poison the people spiritually and degenerate and debase society, improving ideological education and struggle and intensifying legal sanctions against them. In order to successfully carry out the enormous revolutionary tasks facing the government of the Republic, people's government organs should enhance their functions and roles. They should further intensify their unified guidance over the whole society as required by the developing revolution. They should consolidate and develop the socialist political system and carry on the work of accelerating economic and cultural construction. In particular, they should give precedence to economic work and concentrate their efforts on improving the people's living standards. They should put every realm of social life and every region under their supervision and provide unified guidance over them while giving free rein to the creativity of individual sectors and units. People's government organs should establish the trait of making selfless, devoted efforts for the good of the people as appropriate to their basic duty. They should always pay heed to the people's opinions, plan and organize their work in reflection of their demands, find what can be done for them and carry it through to completion, and enlist them in carrying out the Party's lines and policies. They should give top priority to the people's interests and comfort and take responsible care of their living. They should properly enforce the advantageous people-oriented policies including free compulsory education and free medical care, which General Kim Jong Il pursued invariably even in the most trying days, so that the people can feel keenly the gratefulness of the socialist country in their daily life and turn out in the efforts for achieving its prosperity. People's government organs should maintain it as the iron rule to work only under the Party's leadership. They should organize and carry on all work with the Party's ideas and policies as the yardstick, proactively defend the Party's policies and implement with credit the revolutionary tasks advanced by the Party, thereby giving full play to the validity of our Party's policies. Party organizations at all levels should intensify collective guidance over the activities of government organs in conformity with the demands of the developing revolution and actively encourage all their officials to perform their responsibilities and basic duties for the revolution. Officials of people's government organs at all levels should enhance their sense of responsibility and roles. The present stirring realities urgently demand that our officials take the lead in the general offensive and wage a vigorous struggle in order to discharge their duties as befits the leading personnel of the revolution. Officials of people's government organs should possess a high degree of Party spirit and revolutionary principle and conduct their work in a daring and active manner with the attitude that they are fully responsible for it. Courage and activeness arise out of trust in the Party, whereas timidity and acts of basing their actions on how people look at them result from lack of trust in the Party. Officials of people's government organs should definitely root out passive approaches of expediting their work only when the Party throws its full weight behind them, and cherish an unyielding revolutionary work style of carrying through the task set by the Party even though their bodies are torn to pieces. They should constantly cultivate abilities for conceiving, organizing, supervising, guiding and developing their work to become versatile workers who are capable of implementing any tasks with credit. They should acquire our Party's methods of mass work, set personal examples in all undertakings and make tireless efforts for the good of the people. Cherishing deep in their hearts the true meaning of our Party's affection for the people, they should be infinitely courteous to them and become their faithful servants, always sharing weal and woe with them and working with devotion for them. 3 Comrades, At present, our historic struggle for national reunification, a long-cherished desire of the nation, has entered a new phase. We have taken momentous measures in succession to improve inter-Korean relations and ensure peace on the Korean peninsula with a firm resolve to achieve without fail the cause of national reunification, into which the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il put their heart and soul all their life. Last year we held three rounds of historic north-south summit meetings and talks and adopted inter-Korean declarations to bring about a dramatic turn in the relationship. They were events of great significance which turned around the grave situation that was teetering on the brink of war every moment and which heralded the start of a new journey to national reunification. Now the entire nation ardently hopes that the historic Panmunjom Declaration and the September Pyongyang Joint Declaration will thoroughly be implemented so that the peaceful atmosphere on the Korean peninsula will continue and inter-Korean relations will improve uninterruptedly. The south Korean conservative forces, however, are responding to the aspirations of the nation and the unanimous expectations of the international community with too perfidious words and behaviours, and are struggling to bring inter-Korean relations back to those in the period before the publication of the Panmunjom Declaration. The United States openly forces ""speed adjustment"" on the south Korean authorities and tries in every way to subordinate the implementation of inter-Korean agreements to its anti-DPRK policy marked by sanctions and pressure. As a result, a grave situation has been created for us to decide whether to ease the tension on the Korean peninsula and continuously carry on the atmosphere of inter-Korean rapprochement or to return to the past when the tension spiralled up towards a catastrophe with the danger of war looming larger. We cannot look on with folded arms the current situation which causes serious concern over the destiny and future of the nation and peace and security in the region, but we have to take proactive measures without delay to straighten it out in line with the unanimous aspirations of all the fellow countrymen. To this end, it is needed above all to take a proper stand and attitude with which to invariably adhere to and implement the inter-Korean declarations encapsulating the unanimous will of the nation, whatever difficulties and obstacles in the way. I would like to make it clear once again that as I already declared, it is my firm determination to turn, together with the south Korean authorities, inter-Korean relations into a lasting and durable relationship of reconciliation and cooperation and write a new history of the nation that achieves peace and co-prosperity as desired by all the countrymen. In order to untangle the prevailing unsavoury situation, heighten the good atmosphere for improved relations north and south created with much effort and make it bear meaningful fruit of peace and reunification, it is important to put an end to big-power worship marring the spirit of independence and to the policy of dependence on foreign forces encroaching upon the common interests of the nation, and subordinate everything to the improvement of the relations. I think that if the south Korean authorities truly want improved relations, peace and reunification, they should come back to the original intention they had at the time of the Panmunjom summit and the September Pyongyang summit and fulfil the responsibility they have assumed before the nation through the sincere implementation of the north-south declarations. They should not waver in their attitude as they see the tide nor pose as a meddlesome ""mediator"" and ""facilitator"" as they busy themselves with foreign trips, but be a responsible party that defends the interests of the nation speaking what they have to say squarely with the mind of their own as members of the nation. It is our consistent assertion that it is imperative to smash the underhand schemes of the hostile anti-reunification and anti-peace forces within and without in order to sustain the atmosphere of improved inter-Korean relations. It is needed to realize before it is too late that neither progress in inter-Korean relations nor any fruit of peace and prosperity can be expected if the hawkish forces in the south Korean military, who persist in veiled hostility as they resume the military exercises, which were agreed before to be discontinued, jointly with the United States by changing their names, continue to be allowed to make reckless moves, and unless the anachronistic arrogance and hostile policy of the United States, which is creating artificial obstacles in the way of improved relationship as it presents its arbitrary outrageous demand, are eradicated. All the fellow countrymen in north and south and abroad should, staking the destiny and future of the nation, resolutely check and foil the moves of the United States and south Korean conservative forces that go against the historic current towards improved inter-Korean relations and peaceful reunification. If they are truly willing to opt for the improvement of north-south relations, peace and reunification, the south Korean authorities should sympathize with our stand and will, keep pace with us and make a courageous decision to show their sincerity by practical action, not by words. Our Party and the government of our Republic will continue to make sincere and persevering efforts to achieve the sustained development of north-south relations and peaceful reunification of the country, solemnly cherishing the aspirations and desires of the nation in the future, too. Comrades, The first-ever DPRK-US summit meeting and talks, which were held in Singapore in June last year under the world's spotlight, were a momentous occasion that brought the hope of settlement of peace to the Korean peninsula where fire had been exchanged; and the June 12 DPRK-US Joint Statement was a historic declaration announcing to the world that the two countries which had been hostile to each other from one century into the next would write a new history of relationship, and therefore it won full support and approval of the international community aspiring to peace. The DPRK voluntarily took crucial and significant measures including the discontinuation of nuclear test and test-fire of intercontinental ballistic missile, thereby taking the first step towards confidence-building which is the main key to the removal of bilateral hostile relations, and it also took the broadminded measure of realizing the repatriation of the remains of US soldiers, which had been requested by the US President, as a show of its will to sincerely implement the June 12 DPRK-US Joint Statement which serves as a milestone in the establishment of a new bilateral relationship. However, the second DPRK-US summit talks held in Hanoi last February raised strong questions about whether the steps we took under our strategic, courageous decision were right, and they were an occasion that gave us a sense of caution about whether the United States is genuinely interested in improving the bilateral relations. At the talks we expressed our resolve to set the essential stages and course to be followed without fail for the implementation of the June 12 DPRK-US Joint Statement in the interests of both sides and to take more prudent and trustworthy steps, and looked forward to a positive response of the United States. But the United States came to the negotiating table after thinking only about completely unrealizable methods. In other words, they were unprepared to solve problems with us at the table and they had no definite orientation or methodology. By that sort of thinking, the United States will not be able to move us one iota nor get what it wants at all, even if it sits with us a hundred times, a thousand times. It has recently conducted a test for simulated interception of our intercontinental ballistic missile and resumed military exercises the US President committed himself to suspending, while making other hostile moves contrary to the spirit of the June 12 Joint Statement in a more undisguised way. These seriously get on our nerves. I am very displeased with such a trend. As waves rise when wind blows, the more pronounced the US policy hostile towards the DPRK becomes, the tougher our counteraction will become. Although it strongly hints at the settlement of issues through dialogue as it thinks about the third round of DPRK-US summit talks, the United States still looks away from the withdrawal of its hostile policy, the basic way for establishing a new bilateral relationship; rather it mistakenly believes that if it pressures us to the maximum, it can subdue us. We, of course, attach importance to the settlement of issues through dialogue and negotiations, but the US-style dialogue of unilaterally pushing its demands does not fit us, nor are we interested in it. Though the United States calls for a negotiated settlement of issues, it is stirring up hostility to us day after day, which is an act that is as foolish and risky as an attempt to put out fire with oil. Given the deep-rooted animosity between the DPRK and the United States, in order to implement the June 12 Joint Statement both sides should give up their unilateral terms and seek a constructive solution that meets each other's interests. To this end, it is needed above all for the United States to approach us with a new way of calculation after putting aside the current one. The United States is talking much about holding the third round of bilateral summit talks, but we are neither pleased nor willing to see summit talks like the Hanoi summit talks re-enacted. However, as President Trump continuously observes, personal relations between he and I are not hostile like the relationship between the two countries, and we still maintain good relations, and if we want, we can send and receive letters asking for each other's regards any time. If the United States proposed holding the third round of summit talks after finding out with a proper attitude a methodology that can be shared with us, we would be willing to try one more time. But in my opinion at this moment, it comes to my mind that there is no need for me to obsess over the summit talks with the United States out of thirst for the lifting of sanctions. Anyway, we will be patient and wait till the end of this year to see whether the United States makes a courageous decision or not, but it will obviously be hard to get a good opportunity like the last time again. In future, I will put my signature on an agreement without hesitation only when it contains fair clauses which conform to the interests of both sides and which are acceptable to them, and this depends entirely on the stand the United States takes and the way of calculation it comes up with. What is obvious is that if it sticks to its current political way of calculation, the prospects for problem solving will be bleak and very dangerous. At this crucial time, I hope that the United States will make a well-advised judgment and the second hand of the clock of the DPRK-US showdown which they stopped with so much difficulty will not move again for all ages. The government of the Republic will strengthen and develop the bonds of friendship and cooperation with all the countries of the world that respect the sovereignty of our country and are friendly to it, and will advance hand in hand with all the peace-loving forces of the world to establish a lasting and durable peace mechanism on the Korean peninsula. Comrades, As I have just said, I will no longer set my heart on such a trivial issue as lifting sanctions by the hostile forces, but open up the way to prosperity by our own efforts. Although the goal of our struggle is demanding and challenges and difficulties stand in the way of our socialist construction as ever, our Party and the government of our Republic are steadfast in their will to open a new phase of prosperity and achieve the ideal and goal of building a powerful country by their own efforts under the unfurled banner of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism. The road of independence leads to prosperity and victory. Nothing can reverse or stop the dynamic advance of our State and people that have unshakable faith and will to pave their own way by themselves with confidence in their own strength. Let us all make a general advance to successfully accomplish the cause of building a powerful socialist country, holding higher the banner of the great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and firmly rallied

17.03.2020,Kim Jong-un,"Comrades, The Fifth Plenary Meeting of the Seventh Central Committee and the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, both held recently, made an analysis of the situations facing our revolution and put forward correct fighting modes, tasks and ways. This year, when the entire Party and the whole society, having equipped themselves with the ideas and spirit of the plenary meeting, are waging a gigantic struggle to implement the line and policy for independent development in the harshest-ever internal and external situations, is for us an auspicious year as we will be greeting the 75th anniversary of the founding of our Party. Of the challenging and colossal tasks for this year when we have to bring about without fail an epoch-making and lively phase in the course of development of socialism of our own style, we are now faced with the most important and most worthwhile fighting task. The task is building a modern general hospital, which our Party has long planned and aspired after, and we have gathered here today to announce the start of this important and worthwhile project. Frankly speaking, at the plenary meeting of its Central Committee, our Party analyzed and assessed the present state of public health service, medical service, in the country in a comprehensive, scientific and open-hearted way and, feeling miserably self-critical of the fact that there is no perfect and modern medical service establishment even in the capital city, discussed and decided on building in this year of the 75th anniversary of its founding a modern general hospital first in Pyongyang for the promotion of people's health. Accordingly, the Central Committee of the Party delayed several construction projects planned to be conducted this year, and defined the construction of the Pyongyang General Hospital as a major project to be finished by the 75th anniversary of Party founding, a project where primary efforts should be directed among the construction projects to be conducted this year, the first year of the offensive for a frontal attack for making a breakthrough; and over the past more than two months it has made every preparation while going over in a detailed way the plan for finishing the project in the shortest period, ranging from selecting the site, designing, forming construction forces and supplying raw materials. Having indicated a detailed direction for building the hospital in a modern fashion with an eye to the distant future, the Party already had officials in various sectors visit the hospitals that are reputed to be advanced in the world, and on the basis of this, gave guidance so that planning was done on a high level and on a priority basis. As you can see from the drawing of a bird's-eye view of the Pyongyang General Hospital to be built, the project target is quite huge but its period is short. That is why I decided to entrust the project of the Party's first priority and utmost concern to my most reliable construction units, Guards Hero Brigade and the Eighth Construction Bureau, and, though it was unplanned, I have come here to extend militant encouragement to you on ground-breaking. It is important for you to have a correct understanding of the significance of this project, a longcherished wish of our Party. For our Party, which regards the people-first principle as its nature and sacred political creed, to protect and improve the health of the people is the most urgent and honourable revolutionary work, which it should shoulder and undertake without fail whatever the conditions. When our people including the rising generations lead a healthy and cultured life, fully receiving most advanced medical service under the benefit of the socialist public health system, it is a source of greatest happiness and encouragement for our Party. In recent years, modern ophthalmic, dental and other specialized hospitals and children's hospital have been built in Pyongyang, but we cannot be satisfied with these successes as they are only grains of sand in a mountain when compared to the lofty ideals and ambitions of our Party. We should now take the first step to building our public health service to be people-oriented and advanced one with the mindset that we are starting everything in a fresh way. If they had heard that a modern general hospital is going to be built here, an ideal place in Pyongyang, in a big way, Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il would have been most pleased, and this news will also bring pleasure to all our people, young and old, men and women. When the general hospital is built, we will get another valuable asset with which to better protect the precious health and safety of our people, and will be able to set up a springboard for consolidating and developing the socialist public health system by enabling the public health sector of the country to make a significant leap forward with this hospital as a central base. I firmly believe that the general hospital will be wonderfully built encouraging the entire population, who have turned out for the offensive for a frontal attack for making a breakthrough, thanks to the unshakable will of the Workers' Party of Korea that puts forward the work of bolstering up public health sector as a political issue to defend and add luster to the image of socialism of our style and as a crucial undertaking to which the state must direct primary efforts whatever the conditions and situations, and to the ardent patriotic devotion of you who have always been loyal to the call of the Party. Comrades, It is the Party's basic intention to ensure that, through the building of the Pyongyang General Hospital, the spirit of making selfless, devoted efforts for the people runs through today's frontal attack for making a breakthrough and the spirit of carrying out the Party's instructions unto death and the speed of construction that are to be created in the course of building the hospital are rapidly propagated to all sectors of socialist construction. True to the Party's lofty intention to develop our socialist public health service into the most peopleoriented, advanced one which takes full responsibility for protecting all people's life and promoting their health, we should turn out as one for the effort to finish the construction project unconditionally by the 75th founding anniversary of the Party. All the civilian and military officers and builders seconded to this project should work an unprecedented miracle in the worthwhile undertaking for realizing the Party's plan to create another asset for the people, valuing them most. Only 200-odd days are left until the Party founding anniversary day. Needless to say, it is not easy to complete this gigantic project in such a short span of time. The present conditions for this construction are not so favourable, and therefore we may experience many difficulties and trials while building the hospital. But we can neither leave the construction undone nor remain seated idly until good conditions are created. Our Party is under obligation, as required by our people's high aspirations and demands, to make our country more prosperous, bring our people greater happiness and provide them with better care and living conditions. Whatever happens, we must complete the construction of this hospital in an excellent way at the earliest possible date and make the hospital wait for the people. Whether the construction is finished by the set date or not depends entirely on our efforts. The conditions are bad and many difficulties lie ahead; however, we can surely overcome those difficulties that may be encountered in construction when we work actively by enlisting all our effort with an understanding that nobody brings us happiness and creates our future and that we must achieve our happiness by means of our own struggle and create our future with our own hands. We should raise fierce flames of the speed campaign with the indomitable mental strength displayed in the period of ushering in the great golden age of construction under the Party's leadership, and launch a loyal offensive, a fierce 24-7 struggle and a resolute lightning campaign to add brilliance to the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Party with the completion of the proud monumental edifice. It is our Party's demand to set up all architectural structures as ones absolutely perfect both in content and quality in order to make them meet the requirements of the present era and the people and to be used effectively in the people's life not only for the present but also in the distant future. In the true sense of the word architectural structure, it is a building of everlasting value which is different from consumable goods. Although it is well designed and high-quality materials are used in its construction, the quality of an architectural structure cannot be ensured if its building work is not executed effectively. To lower the quality in the execution of building work on the plea of finishing the project as quickly as possible or to slow down the speed on the plea of improving quality runs counter to the ideas and demands of the Party and has nothing to do with the speed campaign which we call for. As you know better than me, if we repeat the execution owing to some faults in its process, it would lead to the waste of large amounts of labour, materials and funds and hamper the speed of construction, with the result that the project cannot be finished on schedule; worse still, such an architectural structure has to be repaired just after its inauguration, causing discomfort for the people, cannot guarantee its lifespan and may cause such a serious consequence as undermining the trustworthiness of our buildings. I emphasize over and over again: It is the heaviest yet noblest duty of all the builders to improve the quality in construction. The quality of a building should be ensured, not under the control of supervisory organs, but by the pure loyalty and conscience towards the Party and the people of the commanding officers, Party members, soldiers and working people who are in charge of every process of the execution of building work. Keeping deep in mind that the work they are doing is an undertaking for the good of the country, the people and themselves, as well as for increasing the number of precious assets of the country to be handed down through generations, all builders should give full play to their collective wisdom and skills by always taking care and controlling and helping one another to improve the quality of the architectural structure. They should root out such a bad habit and work attitude as executing building work in a slipshod way in disregard of the scientific and technological requirements and building methods, strictly observe the building standards and methods at each construction process and devote unsparingly the sweats of their pure conscience regardless of whether they are appreciated or not. By doing so, they can ensure the quality of the project on the highest possible level. It is essential for the builders to intensify the economy drive at every corner of the construction site so as to establish a climate of economizing on building materials including cement, steel and timber to the maximum, maintain attitude and stand befitting masters, display a high sense of responsibility and practise devotion at every process of construction. Construction supervisory organs should, true to their mission and duty, enhance their sense of responsibility and role so that the whole processes of building the hospital become a model and example in meeting the requirements of the design and building methods. To give precedence to supplying building materials and equipment leads to the acceleration of the building speed. The Cabinet, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Construction and Building-materials Industry, the Ministry of Forestry and other ministries and central organs and factories and enterprises should organize and guide production scrupulously and stoke up the flames of the drive for increased production, thus supplying materials and equipment necessary for the construction at the earliest date possible. What is very important here is that the workers of Sangwon and Sunchon should produce sufficient amounts of quality cement and the metallurgical industry produce large quantities of iron and steel. The relevant organs and enterprises should produce and transport fuel oil, timber, glass and others necessary for the construction project without delay and push forward the work of greening the area according to a well-worked-out plan. The relevant units including the Ministry of Public Health should train officials, doctors and nurses who will work at the Pyongyang General Hospital, take practical measures for putting medical service on an intelligent and IT footing, and prepare with a sense of responsibility the medicines, consumables and various equipment necessary for running the hospital. The political section of the construction coordination commission should give full scope to the atmosphere of surge and competition by covering the construction site with the Party's militant slogans and Red flags and launching an uninterrupted ideological offensive by accurately-targeted and focused methods, and thus vigorously propel successful completion of the construction work. All the commanding officers, fully aware that they are entirely responsible in front of the Party for the accomplishment of this important building task, should arrange the organization and command of the construction work in a three-dimensional way and, always at the forefront of the charge, powerfully encourage the builders to performing heroic feats by means of their self-sacrificing efforts and revolutionary traits of setting personal examples. Comrades, The Pyongyang General Hospital, which will rise up high in the centre of the capital city under the manifold difficulties and hardships, will turn into a structure that demonstrates, as they are, the spirit of our country advancing vigorously towards the better future by frustrating cheerfully the mean sanctions and blockade of the hostile forces and the unchangeable situation of our revolution. Let us all build just in this place a wonderful hospital for the people as proudly as to be envied by the world by striving hard with sincere devotion of our sweat and blood for today's honourable and

27.07.2020,Kim Jong-un,"Esteemed comrades war veterans, This is July 27. The victorious July 27 is the day when all the people born on this land celebrate with surging emotions the great victory in the war that is etched in the past history, repeating the word victory. Greeting the holiday of victory today, I am seeing you, esteemed war veterans, again, who created the great history, at this conference. I am so happy that I cannot find words to express my feelings. It is an honour for us to have you, valuable teachers, at this conference. Greeting the 67th anniversary of victory in the great Fatherland Liberation War, I, on behalf of our Workers' Party of Korea and government, extend warm congratulations to you participating in this conference and other veterans of the war and people who performed wartime merits. I also extend noble respects to the revolutionary martyrs, both sung and unsung, who sacrificed their precious lives in the sacred war for achieving the reunification and independence of their country and the freedom and happiness of their fellow people. Availing myself of this opportunity, I offer my noble respects to the martyrs and veterans of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who set a genuine example of militant friendship by helping our people in their revolutionary war at the cost of blood. Esteemed comrades war veterans, We cannot think of our country today without remembering the sweats and blood shed by the generation of the victors in the war, the great spirit they demonstrated and the ennobling sacrifice of the warriors. We will remember them for ever. It is our Party's mind always to see you, who performed immortal feats etched in the history of our country, and give prominence to and feel proud of your heroic lives with dignity. This conference will prove an important opportunity for demonstrating at home and abroad the unanimous aspiration and will of our Party and all our people to hand down more vividly the exploits of the war veterans to posterity and carry forward the fighting spirit of the 1950s so as to translate the forerunners' ennobling desires to reality without fail. The distinguished feats performed by the victorious wartime generation of the 1950s under the leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung and the spiritual wealth and assets they bequeathed to the coming generations are becoming more precious things that cannot be bartered with anything else as the days go by. The major and profound meaning of our victorious July 27 in modern history is never confined to the fact that a country and nation defended their dignity and sovereignty in a fight against the aggressors and created a military miracle that would shine in the annals of the human history of war. The great Fatherland Liberation War was a grim war for defending our Republic in its cradle and the destiny and future of tens of millions of our people and, at the same time, the first all-out war between the forces aspiring after independence and the dominationist forces, between socialism and capitalism, that was fought with the start of the Cold War after the Second World War. As such, no precedent could be found in the fierceness and the seriousness of the confrontation. We could not be compared to the enemy in all aspects including the military hardware and economic strength as well as population and territory, but in this war our newborn Republic checked the military offensive by the US imperialists, who had been boasting of being the ""strongest"" in the world, and their vassal forces and defended its territory and sovereignty at the cost of blood. This was a greatest event that wrote an unprecedented heroic and legendary tale in the histories of our nation and the world revolution. The July 27 constituted a turning point in making our country and people that had been reduced to a weak state and nation take pride of place in history as a heroic country and people admired by the world and in bringing about violent storms of revolutions for anti-imperialist independence, socialism and national liberation on the globe. But for the great July 27, there would not have been today of socialist Korea demonstrating its glories as the most dignified and independent powerful country, a people's country, in the present-day world and the imperialists' high-handed attempts to put Asia and the rest of the world in the sphere under their domination would not have been checked. It defined the orientation of the new great history of the postwar socialist revolution and construction, created the proud traditions and wealth with which our country and people could achieve victory for ever, transformed the global political landscape and forcefully propelled the trend of the times towards independence and socialism–this is another great meaningfulness of the July 27. The victory in the Fatherland Liberation War was the victory of the ennobling patriotism and mass heroism of our service personnel of the Korean People's Army and people, the victory of justice and progress over injustice and reaction and the victory of socialism, the future of mankind, over capitalism, the refuse of history. The Fatherland Liberation War, which made one clearly aware of the aggressive and brutal natures of the US imperialism and never forget them, deprived all the people on this land of their parents, brothers and sisters and their precious comrades-in-arms and friends, and brought them disastrous misfortunes and pains. However, thanks to the legendary feats of the victorious wartime generation, who overcame all those pains and trials, the great spirit of defending the country and revolution was created and unparalleled heroism, self-sacrifice and fortitude became solid as traits unique to our people. Our victorious wartime generation is a proud generation that created a new history of carrying forward the Korean revolution by dedicating their blood and lives and developed the revolutionary spirit of Paektu into an all-people ideological spirit. Thanks to the service personnel, who defended every inch of their motherland at the cost of blood with the steely faith that they would surely emerge victorious as long as they were led by Comrade Kim Il Sung, and to the people on the home front, who dedicated their all to the victory in the war, the spirit of unity around the leader, the indefatigable spirit of fighting the enemy to the death and the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance of making weapons with bare hands could be displayed highly as a mettle of heroic Korea. That is why our Party holds in high esteem and give prominence to the victorious wartime generation, who brought about the victory at the cost of blood amid the flames of the war, as a proud generation who laid a cornerstone for carrying forward our revolutionary traditions. They are also heroes who, true to the Party's call, established a socialist system and laid the foundations of an independent, powerful country in the spirit of Chollima, and great teachers who implanted an ennobling spirit and soul in the hearts of the rising generations. In the days when they played the key roles in all sectors, our socialist construction witnessed the fastest eye-opening advance and upsurge, and the tales of their feats have served as sustenance and an excellent textbook of revolutionary life and outlook on life for the peacetime generations who have not undergone the experience of a war. They, indeed, are excellent revolutionaries and patriots and invaluable treasures of our revolution who, though they themselves experienced trials, have devoted their all to the rising generations by invariably and faithfully supporting the Party and the leader in the whole course, beginning with the grim war days to the days of postwar reconstruction and socialist construction. Our Party regards it as a source of great pride and honour to have such revolutionary forerunners as you, who have cherished an ennobling view on the rising generation and on the revolution, and gives prominence to the victorious wartime generation as models whom everyone should learn from for all ages. Esteemed comrades war veterans, The history of nearly 70 years after the war cannot be called peacetime as a fierce confrontation with the enemy has continued, and the threat and pressure by the imperialists to invade and plunder our state have increased moment by moment. With the spirit and will of victory brought about by the immortal July 27, we chose on our own accord the arduous road of strengthening the national power, looking towards a bright future of our state, and have never changed our choice, tightening our belts, when others were vying with one another for the pursuit of immediate ""prosperity."" As we must have an absolute strength with which to prevent and deter the war itself so as not to experience once again the pains and sufferings of the war in the 1950s, we have advanced along the road of self-development toward a nuclear state by braving all pressures and challenges and overcoming unprecedented adversity which would have brought others to their knees one hundred times. And now we have become able to reliably defend ourselves against any form of high-intensity pressure and military threat by imperialist reactionaries and other hostile forces. War is an armed clash which can be unleashed only against a weak one. None can now make little of us. We will not allow others to look down upon us and, if they do so, make them pay dearly. Thanks to our reliable and effective self-defence nuclear deterrence, the word war would no longer exist on this land, and the security and future of our state will be guaranteed for ever. We celebrate July 27 every year from one generation to the next, but the day of this year, when our state has secured the strategic position the world cannot ignore but recognize, brings us a special emotion, and the significance of the victory in the war and the exploits of performed by the war veterans have become more valuable and prideful. Comrades, A long time has passed and many things have changed since the gunshots of the war ended, but the ennobling spirit the war martyrs and veterans displayed is still here, encouraging our people to a renewed struggle. In the faces of you, war veterans, we are now visualizing the images of all the comrades-inarms who failed to come back from the front in those grim years and the unforgettable martyrs who devoted themselves for socialist construction, and are girding ourselves to make redoubled efforts so as to be proud of ourselves before them. Just as you wrote a new chapter in the history of building a prosperous country by brilliantly carrying forward the traditions of the antiJapanese struggle, the new generations of today will achieve the final victory of socialism of our own style without fail by inheriting your spirit. The history of the victorious war teaches us the iron truth that a people armed with a great spirit can work a great miracle. By etching the spirit in the 1950s in the minds of all the service personnel and people in golden letters, our Party will ensure that every one of them becomes a fighter who remains unchanged in any adversities and leads the life of artists of fresh miracles and victories so that they have no feeling of shame in front of the martyrs and war veterans. We have never forgotten your rancour that you had to turn back in bitter tears after burying your fallen comrades-in-arms on the shore of the Raktong near the South Sea of Korea owing to a shortage of arms. Always remembering the truth that only when we have our sovereignty and right to existence guaranteed, can we achieve and promote happiness and in order to defend the destiny of our state and people, we must have strong power of our own, we will not halt even a moment on the road of building up the most powerful defence capabilities which no one would dare to challenge. Comrades, What the fighters of the war pictured in their minds so dearly in the so many days and nights of the do-or-die battles must have been a beautiful people's paradise which would be built in the 3 000-ri land. Our Party will strive with redoubled courage to realize the forerunners' dream and ideal of a powerful country without fail and make our people the happiest in the world. All the people should glorify their lives as victors on the road of making their country prosperous, viewing themselves in the light of the lives of the victorious wartime generation. The present conditions and situation are difficult, but they are nothing when compared to those during the war days. Our Party will make sure that all officials, Party members and other working people achieve proud victories on all fronts of socialist construction by holding up the slogan ""Let us live and struggle in the spirit of the great defenders of the country!"" It will also prepare all the service personnel to be versatile, a-match-for-a-hundred combatants who have acquired the indomitable revolutionary spirit, valiant militant mettle and lofty patriotism cherished by the war veterans as part of their mental qualities and are well-versed in our style of warfare. The history of victorious war hands down to posterity the feats of numerous heroes including Ri Su Bok, Jo Kun Sil and Kang Ho Yong in connection with the word youth. The Party will bring up all young people to be hot-blooded loyal persons and staunch revolutionaries who take the Party and country into account first and are ready to dedicate themselves for the sake of society and the collective like those heroes who unhesitatingly dedicated their only lives for the one and only country in the face of death. In this way, it can ensure that our great traditions of our ideology and system you defended at the cost of your blood and our victory is carried forward from one generation to the next. It will ensure that the climate of respecting, holding up and according preferential treatment to war veterans and other forerunners in the revolution is created across society and becomes an unshakable national trait. Our Party will look after you, war veterans, with all sincerity and hold full responsibility for your health and life so that you can become more vigorous even though you are getting older continue to add brilliance to your glorious life in good health. It will make sure that Party organizations, government bodies, working people's organizations at all levels and all the people regard it as part of their noble obligation and duty to take good care of war veterans as they would do their own parents, and do all they can do for them. Although time passes and one generation is replaced by another, the heroic fighting spirit and undying feats of the victorious wartime generation will boil the red blood of our descendants harder for all eternity and the great spirit and feats will live for ever with the victorious advance of our revolution. Esteemed comrades veterans, You, staunch war veterans, defeated the US imperialists that had boasted of being the ""strongest"" in the world and the armies of their followers and weathered those severe years and all sorts of hardships; but as the saying goes that time and tide wait for no man, many of the veterans have passed away and the hair of you, present here, has turned gray. Seeing this, I feel sorry and regretful that time flies. Comrades war veterans, I wish and wish you good health. I sincerely request the respected war veterans across the country to lead a long life in good health, serving as the eternal source of our strength and spiritual mainstay. Long live the great July 27 victory!",esteemed comrade war veteran july victorious july bear land celebrate surge emotion victory war etch past history repeat word victory greet holiday victory today

10.10.2020,Kim Jong-un,"All the people and service personnel of the country, who are greeting the auspicious October holiday, Officers and men of the Public Security Forces and members of the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and Young Red Guards, Delegates to the celebrations of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea and Pyongyang citizens, Officers and men of the units participating in the military parade held in celebration of the glorious October holiday, Dear comrades, The founding anniversary of our glorious Party has come. The night of great glory has come. At last on this glorious night we are greeting the Party's founding anniversary of this year, which was beset with unprecedented difficulties; I don't know why, but this fact alone moves me too much. Greeting the 75th founding anniversary of our great Party, I, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, extend heartfelt congratulations to all those who have glorified this October holiday with great honour and pride. I extend warm thanks and congratulations to all our people. Comrades, On this night of the great holiday, the streets in the capital city and this square are so splendid and seethe with pleasure and pride, but we must not forget that this glorious moment of today is being defended by the many Party members, workers and service personnel of our revolutionary armed forces who are performing unassuming efforts and devotion across the country. How many people have made devoted efforts overcoming harsh circumstances this year so as to bring about and defend this glorious moment of today! How many challenges have we overcome to come as far as here! In particular, our service personnel performed devotion on the anti-epidemic front and the front of removing the aftereffects of natural disasters which we had to face this year unexpectedly. No one would approach their patriotic and heroic devotion without shedding tears of gratitude. They would say that defending their country, people and revolution is a task inherent to the People's Army, but the pains they have taken are too great. They have undertaken to perform too many tasks and have taken too great pains. This is why I feel deep regret for them, and I feel pain in my heart as they are not all here at this glorious night with us. At this very moment, many of our service personnel are courageously striving on the antiepidemic front and at the rehabilitation project sites far away from this glorious Kim Il Sung Square in defence of the security of the state and safety of the people. Our army is performing its mission as a motive force of national defence with such credit in the face of unforeseen challenges posed by the epidemic and the forces of nature, as well as the military threats by the hostile forces. I extend the highest tribute to their ardent loyal and filial devotion to our state and people and warm thanks to all the service personnel. I also offer my militant encouragement and thanks to my most dependable combatants of the divisions of the WPK members from the capital city, our hardcore force. They are patriots who deserve to be present here, but they volunteered, after completing their tasks in rehabilitation projects, to other disaster areas instead of returning to Pyongyang where there are their dear homes. My militant greetings and thanks go also to other working people across the country. I hope that only happiness and joy will come to the families that have settled down in new villages and homes after getting rid of the aftereffects of the natural calamities, and to other families across the country. I hope that our children's happy dreams will come true all the time. Availing myself of this opportunity, I offer my heartfelt consolation to all those around the world who are still combating the disease caused by the malignant virus, and do pray from the bottom of my heart that health, happiness and laughter of all people would be guaranteed. I also send this warm wish of mine to our dear fellow countrymen in the south, and hope that this health crisis would come to an end as early as possible and the day would come when the north and south take each other's hand again. Comrades, We all have gathered on this October celebration square with valuable successes and fruits of labour, which we have achieved with all our effort. It was not so easy for us to come as far as here. We had to fight one arduous struggle after another and overcome countless ordeals. Although the 75-year-long history of our Party was fraught with difficulties, every day and every step was truly arduous and trying from the outset of this year in particular as unexpected grave challenges and obstacles cropped up. We have come to this meaningful place with the pride and honour of having braved them all. This gathering, which the world people would admire, demonstrates that we have overcome all the calamities that troubled us and blocked our way and that we have attained with success our justifiable fighting goals. Dear comrades, Today we are greeting the 75th founding anniversary of our Party on a grand scale. No other country in the world would celebrate a party's founding anniversary as a happy holiday and grand auspicious event of all its people as our country does. As I stand here tonight, which is emotive and delightful and brims over with the great joy of all our people, I am afraid that I don't know what to say first to them. I thought over what I would say first at this moment, when we will be looking back upon every page of our Party's 75-year history filled with glory, but my heartfelt, sincere word for our people is only one, thanks. First of all, I thank them for being healthy free from disease. I wanted to say this without fail. I thank them for their good health without any one of them having fallen victim to the malignant virus. The fact that we have defended all our people from the harmful epidemic disease sweeping the whole world can be said to be a natural duty and success of our Party. However, I am moved by this success, and as I see their healthy appearance, I can find no word other than thanks. Today's victory that is striking the world with admiration is a great victory achieved by our people themselves. For our Party, the life of every one of our people is more precious than anything else, and their good health means the very existence of our Party, state and everything on this land. In this world, however, there are too many unstable elements threatening and attempting to harm the priceless life of our people. So, as a matter of fact, at the beginning of this year, I had big worries and fear owing to the onset of the world health crisis and unfavourable situations around us. However, our people got rise to their feet with great perseverance in absolute support of and trust in the measures taken by the Party and the state, and not only safeguarded their destiny resolutely but also bravely overcame severe hardships and trials with animation. But for such excellent people who worry, care and protect one another and but for the socialist society, in which these people live in cooperation with a high sense of patriotism and a high level of self-consciousness, we would not have prevented the horrible catastrophe. As all our people turned out as one in the struggle for defending their state, themselves and their children, becoming the motive force of the anti-epidemic work of their own accord, the country's anti-epidemic sector which was backward and lacking in everything could be revitalized, and anti-epidemic stability which is inconceivable to others could be maintained. It is very grateful and encouraging for me that everybody lives in a large harmonious family although life is not affluent yet and they are healthy without even one of them having fallen victim to the evil virus. There are no grateful people in the world other than ours who truly understand the difficult situations facing the state and cope with them, regarding them as their household affairs. On this planet at present, our country is the only one that is faced with huge challenges and difficulties, like dealing with the anti-epidemic emergency and recovering from the catastrophic natural disasters, when everything is in short supply owing to the harsh and prolonged sanctions. All of these hardships are undoubtedly a heavy burden and pain for every family and every citizen in our country. However, our people are grateful patriots who place national affairs before their family ones, share every difficulty experienced by the state with it, and firmly support their country with their sincere sweats and efforts. That is why our Party braves all sorts of national hardships by believing in and relying on them, who always turn out as one if it unburdens itself of the situations of the country. Our people have always been grateful to our Party, but it is none other than themselves who surely deserve a bow of gratitude. Over the past 75 years our people have supported the Party single-heartedly and defended our sacred revolutionary cause by shedding sweat and even their blood unsparingly and unhesitatingly. The secret of how our Party, which has followed the revolutionary road, most arduous and beset with trials, has adorned this bloody road with victory and glory is that our people have sincerely trusted and supported it and defended its cause. No one can think about even a moment of our Party's glorious 75-year history without our great people, an omnipotent creator of history. They have always provided it with wisdom and resourcefulness as a wise mentor, infused it with inexhaustible strength and courage, defended it at the cost of their lives, supported it sincerely and turned its plans and lines into reality. When it called on them to bring about a great upsurge, the great people responded to it with the mettle of Chollima; when it mapped out an operation for grand construction, they responded to it with the speed campaign; they thus translated the Party's decisions without fail going through fire and water. As these great people have always been with our Party, it has always been firm and able to record miracles in the annals of this land whatever the adversity. Seeing the images of our people who have won victory for the great October holiday overcoming all manner of hardships with boundless loyal and filial devotion, indomitable fighting spirit and sincere efforts, I feel with great pride the almighty strength with which they would follow and defend the Party for another 75 years, nay, 750 years and even 7 500 years Comrades, Our people have placed trust, as high as sky and as deep as sea, on me, but I have failed to always live up to it satisfactorily. I am really sorry for that. Although I am entrusted with the important responsibility to lead this country upholding the cause of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il thanks to the trust of all the people, my efforts and sincerity have not been sufficient enough to rid our people of the difficulties in their life. Our people, however, have always believed and absolutely trusted me, and supported my choice and determination, whatever it is. Even if it may mean suffering more, our people's trust in me and our Party is always absolute and steadfast. Such ardent and sincere trust and encouragement is the most valuable wealth for me, which cannot be bartered with any fame and millions of tons of gold, and inexhaustible strength which encourages me to have no fear and know no impossibility. As I enjoy this greatest trust which no one in this world can ever expect, I have been able to confront without hesitation all manner of challenges remembering the mission and will to make selfless, devoted efforts for the good of the people, jump into do-or-die battles, which would lead even to a war, and uncompromisingly cope with the disasters unprecedented in history. I will cherish it as the highest honour to have, serve and struggle for such excellent people. I solemnly swear once again in this place that I will live up to the people's trust without fail even if my body is torn and crushed to pieces on the way of defending their great trust and that I will remain faithful to that trust. Dear guests and other people across the country, Thank you, indeed. I extend my heartfelt thanks to you with humble reverence along with the hearts of Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. Comrades, It is our Party's and my first and foremost mission and steadfast will to firmly defend our people, hold them in greater respect and make them lead a happy life envying nothing. Our Party has already built up the strongest military capability of safeguarding peace, with which to firmly defend socialism, the dignity and lifeline of our people, and to make our people enjoy the benefits of prosperity generation after generation on this land, eternally free from war. Today's ranks of military parade lined in gallant array will clearly show how the Workers' Party of Korea has trained its revolutionary army and how powerful the army's strength is. As everyone will clearly see today, comparing it with the military parade held in this place in celebration of the 70th founding anniversary of the WPK only five years ago, the modernity of our military forces has remarkably improved and anyone can easily guess the speed of its development. We have a powerful large contingent of faithful and competent personnel in the sector of defence science and technology and workers in the munitions industry, who are firmly equipped with their Party's revolutionary ideology and truly serve the interests of their revolution. Our military capability has developed and changed to such an extent that no one can make little of and keep parallel with it. We have built a deterrent with which we can satisfactorily control and manage any military threats that we are facing or may face. Our military capability is changing in the rate of its growth and in its quality and quantity in our own style and in accordance with our demands and our timetable. Our Party defined the military capability with which to overpower in advance the forces that may dare to threaten or infringe on the rights to independence and existence of our state and people as the most assured and strong national defence capability. And it has made every effort to possess military forces that can achieve the purpose and is now attaining the upgraded targets steadily. We will continue to strengthen the war deterrent, the righteous self-defence means, so as to contain and control all the dangerous attempts and intimidatory acts by the hostile forces, including their sustained and aggravating nuclear threat. Our war deterrent, which is intended to defend the rights to independence and existence of our state and safeguard peace in the region, will never be abused or used as a means for preemptive strike. But, if, and if, any forces infringe upon the security of our state and attempt to have recourse to military force against us, I will enlist all our most powerful offensive strength in advance to punish them. I never want that our military strength would aim at someone else. We clarify that our war deterrent is being developed not for aiming at others. We are developing it in order to defend ourselves. If we don't have our own strength, the only thing we have to do is to wipe the streaming tears and blood though our fists are clenched. Our Party, with powerful military strength, will guarantee the sovereignty of the country and reliable security of its territory and safeguard the eternal safety, peace and future of the state and people. Comrades, Thanks to our revolutionary armed forces equipped with the revolutionary ideology of the WPK, unbounded loyalty and filial piety to the country and people and powerful up-to-date weapons embodying the strength and soul of our people, any aggressive force will never be able to make little of our sacred country nor dare to check the advance of the Korean people. What is left now is to ensure that our people enjoy a sufficient and civilized life to the full free from difficulties any longer. Our Party will invariably administer and ceaselessly expand the advantageous policies and measures, which are aimed at improving the people's wellbeing and providing more benefits to them, and bring as earlier as possible the ideal society of prosperity that our people are dreaming of. Sharing destiny with the people in the face of severe trials and experiencing the united strength of our people till now, our Party has come to know well what it should do in the future. The Eighth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea will advance plans and detailed targets for doing it, and our Party's struggle for providing the people with happiness will develop onto a new stage. The further we develop, the more rampant the reactionary forces of all hues may become, and more unexpected trials may face us. However, they will be nothing compared with what we have experienced until now and we have the strength and confidence with which to overcome them all. The single-hearted unity of the Party and the masses of the people consolidated in the long course of the struggle and the talent force and asset for self-sustenance provided by our socialism–these will surely become a powerful force that propels and accelerates our advance. Our Party and people, who have achieved everything that others would not have dared to attempt by surmounting all manner of immeasurable trials and hardships that others had never experienced, will start their advance towards new development and prosperity with greater courage and confidence, unusual passion and preparedness. I will ensure that all Party organizations, the government and power and military organs make more and more strict demands on themselves, direct strenuous efforts and work with sincerity for our people and for bringing a better tomorrow to them. The ideal of our people is great, and the day when it is realized will surely come. I will direct all my efforts to realizing the great ideal so as to ensure that innovations, development and substantial changes which everyone can feel are made in the struggle for attaining higher targets in socialist construction. Comrades, we have become strong and are becoming stronger in the midst of trials. Time is by our side. Let us all advance vigorously towards a bright future of socialism, towards a fresh victory! Last, I once again extend thanks to all the people for being in good health free from any disease. And I also extend my heartfelt thanks to them for invariably trusting in our Party.

24.03.2021,Kim Jong-un,"All the builders and service personnel who have turned out in the honourable project for building up the capital city, Today we are honoured to set up another meaningful landmark in the history of building up our capital city. The Eighth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Second Plenary Meeting of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party held early this year decided on building 50 000 flats in our capital city and, to this end, building 10 000 flats every year while pushing ahead with the construction of houses across the country in the five-year plan period. The most worthwhile and glorious revolutionary task of the weighty and gigantic fighting tasks decided by the Party Congress will start to be undertaken full steam today. Building 50 000 modern flats in Pyongyang, the capital city of our great country, is something our Party has long intended, made preparations for and aspired to do in order to provide the citizens of the capital city with more cultured and stabler living conditions. The Party and the government acquainted themselves with the number of households that need houses and made an in-depth study of the measures for solving this problem. And they have regarded this project as their most important task. Having accepted this colossal project willingly as an honourable revolutionary task which it must implement without fail however difficult the conditions and environment may be, the Party Central Committee reaffirmed its plan of architectural development and construction policy on the principle of applying the people-first principle more thoroughly. It redefined the orientation and order of construction, ensured that a large share of the total state budget for construction was allocated for the construction of houses and, on the basis of plans and preparation to this end, made the construction of 50 000 flats a policy at its Eighth Congress. This large-scale operation for building flats unfolded by our Party and state is not something for pursuing any economic profits; it is an ennobling undertaking to turn the assets of the state and fruits of creative labour of the working masses thoroughly into their benefits. If we build from today 50 000 flats until 2025 when we will greet the 80th founding anniversary of the Party–10 000 flats every year–we will have almost 70 000 flats built, including over 16 000 flats now under construction, thus solving the housing problem of the citizens of the capital city once and for all. Undertaking the project of building houses in the capital city in a bold way and on a large scale is of great significance also in demonstrating the unquenchable fighting spirit of our state and people that are advancing audaciously against manifold difficulties. As you must all know, this project was decided after much thought. To tell the truth, to undertake this large-scale project in the circumstances of today, when the challenges and difficulties are harsher than ever before, is something beyond imagination. Construction of 10 000 flats this year is to be conducted in the circumstances completely different from when we started building Ryomyong Street five years ago; worse still, we have to do in a short time the amount of work many times larger than that of those days. Our Party, however, decided to push ahead with the project unconditionally as it is directly related with the living of the citizens of the capital city and as it is an important political undertaking of the first year of implementing the decisions of the Party Congress to the letter. We have the proud dignity and pluck that we are conducting a gigantic and wonderful project in the most trying days; we also have the self-confidence, experience and assets for surely carrying it out. If the characteristic multistoried and skyscraping apartment houses which we see in the architectural formation plan now are built in these Songsin and Songhwa areas by the end of this year, the potential of our state and the creative strength of our people will be displayed to the full once again. In the course of this, our Juche-oriented architecture will make another leap of development and our construction aimed at creating a new life of our own style by our own efforts and with our own hands will gain a bigger momentum. The advanced architectural technologies and construction methods such as green architecture and dry-building methods will be introduced in an aggressive and innovative way, the foundations of the industrial bases that produce building equipment and materials will be further expanded and strengthened, and our construction units and builders will become more powerful and skilful. The grand construction of today will be of monumental significance in the history of building the capital city. The project of building 50 000 flats, which begins now, is a historic one of building modern, large-scale streets, expanding the urban areas of Pyongyang, the capital city, to the direction of east, west and north. If 10 000 flats and distinctive public buildings are built every year in the areas of Songsin, Songhwa, Sopho, Kumchon and September 9 Street, respectively, the capital city of our state will witness a more magnificent change and they will become significant monuments, symbolic of the most arduous yet glorious third decade of the 21st century. The citizens and their offspring who will live in the new streets we are building will remember down through the generations the builders of our era, who built the enormous architectural groups of world class by overcoming the worst trials, as heroic people. Today's large-scale construction is, indeed, a great undertaking for writing an era of glory in history. Comrades, Construction is an ensemble of the mental standard of the relevant era and the strength of the relevant nation and a long step towards civilization and development Today, when we are advancing to achieve prosperity and development upholding our state-first principle, this project will constitute a major thrust area symbolic of the era of a fresh upsurge and massive transformation in socialist construction. Through this project, we will renovate the appearance of the capital city once again and usher in an era of fresh dynamic advance which will develop socialist construction by stage with confidence. When mapping out this project of a massive scale, the Party Central Committee paid its primary attention to forming the major forces which would play the main, powerful role in the project. What our Party Central Committee believed first when deciding on this project was none other than the revolutionary armed forces that are boundlessly faithful to the Party and the people. While performing its mission and responsibility of staunchly defending the country and the people, the People's Army has always played a big role also in creating the people's happiness. Only when the People's Army which has performed heroic feats in numerous grand construction projects and in the theatres of rehabilitating damaged areas undertakes to a major project, can a sure victory be achieved in the overall construction projects. I know our People's Army better than anybody else. I am convinced that the officers and men of the People's Army will fully prove themselves worthy of the expectations of the Party and the people with thoroughgoing implementation by giving full play to their militant temperament in this creative struggle of construction, too. Also participating in the current grand construction are the major civilian construction units including the Capital City Construction Commission, High-Speed Youth Shock Brigade, Revolutionary Site Construction Bureau and External Construction Bureau that have performed remarkable feats at major construction projects like that of building Ryomyong Street. Success or failure in this grand construction depends on the commanding officials, service personnel and civilian builders who are in direct charge of it. The construction policy and guidance of our Party and state are ultimately translated into reality by the creative enthusiasm and endeavour of every commanding official, and the Party places its belief first in the ardent patriotic spirit and skills of our builders. The task facing the sector of designing is most important. Construction itself is a highly creative undertaking, and buildings are now getting formative, artistic, multi-functional and intelligent. This adds to the importance of designing. What our Party asks of the sector of designing is that a single dot or a line placed on a blueprint should reflect the ideology, soul and vibrant spirits of our times and embody the lofty ideals and standards of civilization that can proudly lead the world. In accordance with the street formation plan and the designing plan which have already been decided and issued, the designers should draw up all the designs of the project on a perfect level to fully embody the Party's idea on architectural beauty, and hand them over to the construction sector as soon as possible. All the construction units responsible for building operations should start construction work without delay and execute their daily, weekly and monthly plans without fail according to schedule to complete the frameworks of the buildings in their charge within the first half of this year in the main. All the construction detachments and units should regard it as their main task to improve the quality of construction, and consistently hold fast to the principle of ensuring quality throughout the whole process of construction work. When all the officials and builders always maintain the stance and attitude that their loyalty, patriotism and conscience will be verified by the Party, state, people, posterity and history, all structures can become excellent creations of our times both in name and reality. The construction supervision sector should enhance its role so as to ensure that the construction policy of the Party and state is executed and the people's demands and interests and the stability of architecture are thoroughly met. It is necessary to supply on a top priority and timely basis the materials and equipment needed for the construction of 10 000 flats. Factories and enterprises assigned for the production of cement, steel materials and various other building materials and equipment should fulfil their production quotas satisfactorily on schedule by giving fullest play to the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the working class, thus ensuring the success of the construction of the flats in the capital city. The railway and other transport sectors should also launch a vigorous campaign for increased transport to ensure prompt transportation of the materials needed by the grand construction sites in the capital city and by the production bases of steel and other building materials. We should give precedence to political work and ideological offensive in all undertakings so as to give full play to the loyalty, patriotism and creative wisdom of the soldiers of the People's Army and other builders, and make all the construction sites seethe with a high spirit from the beginning to the end of the projects. In this way, we can not only enlist the masses in the worthwhile struggle for construction, but also turn the present gigantic capital city construction sites just into fierce revolutionary battlefields and excellent schools that produce a new spirit of the times and train brave practitioners and stalwart socialist working people. We should also attach utmost importance to taking good care of the health and life of the soldiers and other builders engaged in construction In keeping with the requirements of the state epidemic prevention emergency system, it is necessary to build epidemic prevention stations and facilities and establish a climate of observing the epidemic prevention regulations voluntarily and thoroughly throughout the construction sites. Utmost concern should be directed to preventing all kinds of accidents and disasters and making the builders engage in their work without feeling any inconvenience. Supply service for the soldiers and other builders should not be left only to the units concerned, but the state supply system should be scrupulously organized so that the exact amount of supply for each builder is given to him. Comrades, Today we are breaking ground for this project, but some months later a new street for the people, a splendid architectural group we will all feel proud of, will be built in this area. Nothing is more worthwhile and honourable and happier than to unhesitatingly dedicate our sweat and passion to building an ideal street which will be a dear cradle for nobody else but our people who are the best and greatest in the world. For the future of our capital which will become more beautiful and magnificent, For our parents, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters who will create and enjoy there a new civilization to their heart's content, and For the brilliant implementation of the decisions of the Eighth Party Congress, Let us all fight vigorously.",builder service personnel turn honourable project build capital city

09.04.2021,Kim Jong-un,"Dear comrade cell secretaries, The Sixth Conference of Cell Secretaries of the Workers' Party of Korea is being held when the whole country is in a remarkably high spirit in the efforts for implementing the decisions adopted at the Eighth Congress of the WPK and the Second Plenary Meeting of its Eighth Central Committee. Availing myself of this opportunity of seeing you here, you comrade cell secretaries who always live and work with all the Party's members and the other working people boundlessly faithful to the Party and the revolution, I would like to extend, in the name of the Party Central Committee as well as mine, warm thanks and greetings to you, participants in this Conference, and all other cell secretaries and members of the Party for working with devotion for the strengthening of our Party and the prosperity and development of our country. Dear comrade cell secretaries, Really heavy are the duties you have assumed in this pivotal period, an important phase in the strengthening of our Party and the development of our revolution. This is because the implementation of the decisions of the Party congress aimed at advancing our style of the socialist cause on a higher stage by achieving a tangible change and development in the economic work, in improving the people's living standards and in all other fields even in the worst-ever situation in which we have to overcome unprecedentedly numerous challenges depends on the role played by the cells, the grass-roots organizations of the Party; it is also because the fighting efficiency of the Party cells depends on their secretaries.The fighting programmes and policies set forth by the Party congress and the plenary meeting of the Party Central Committee can be executed to the letter and bear rich fruits only when all the organizations of the Party, its cells to be concrete, accept them correctly and turn out in a fierce struggle for implementing them. Cell secretaries are replaced by other persons more often than not across the Party, and there are many cell secretaries who have just assumed their position. Given the situation, it is the intention of our Party Central Committee to meet the cell secretaries across the Party at a regular interval, so as to discuss the cell work, guide and assist them and thereby consistently strive to strengthen the Party cells. Proceeding from this, the Party congress prioritized the work of politically and practically preparing the cell secretaries who are in charge of the grass-roots combat units for executing the Party's lines and policies, and stipulated in the Party Rules that a conference of cell secretaries shall be held every five years in keeping with a Party congress. There are many Communist and Workers' parties in the world, but it is only our Party that holds a conference of leaders of its grass-roots organizations on a regular basis so that its Central Committee can discuss work with them face to face. To consolidate itself as a whole by strengthening grass-roots organizations is a principle of its building inherent and unique to our Party and its proud tradition. Our Party Central Committee frequently meets the cell secretaries, who are always among the Party's members, listens to their opinions and teaches them in order to communicate with the broad sections of the Party's members and the other working people in this course and lead the revolution and construction in conformity with their opinions and requirements. The work of thoroughly preparing the cell secretaries who are in the position of linking it with the masses by the same bond of blood relationship and organizing and enlisting the Party's members and the other working people to implement its lines and policies is the most important activity of the Central Committee of our Party. This is why the Party Central Committee regards a conference of cell secretaries as important as a Party congress and directs much effort to ensuring it a success. Although some successes have been achieved in the work of strengthening the Party cells and increasing their role since the Fifth Conference of the Cell Chairpersons of the Workers' Party of Korea, there are quite a few shortcomings as well. To immediately correct the shortcomings latent in the work of Party cells is an inevitable process that should be followed by our Party for its healthy and sustainable development; and only then can our Party creditably carry out its mission as the militant General Staff that leads the revolution and construction with its roots struck deep among the masses of the people. Even though the shortcomings may be partial and small, they should never be neglected. To identify a practical means for turning all the Party cells, its grass-roots organizations, into united and militant collectives and apply it actively to their work so as to make the short cut to strengthening the whole Party even shorter and dynamically advance socialist construction–this is the important objective of convening this conference in a grand manner. You must be well aware of this. Comrades, Cell secretaries are hard-core members of our Party and standard bearers in implementing Party policy. The Party Central Committee expects that you will work in a more proactive and responsible way to strengthen the Party cells. This conference will comprehensively review and analyze work of the cell secretaries since the Fifth Conference of Cell Chairpersons of the Workers' Party of Korea, and discuss the tasks and ways for decisively improving and intensifying the work of its cells at present. You should participate in this conference with a high level of political consciousness and enthusiasm, so as to study in real earnest how you are supposed to do if you are to inspire the Party's members and the other working people to the implementation of the decisions of the Party congress and possess the qualities befitting the primary political officials of the Workers' Party. It is important that, while looking back on your work in combination with the issues to be discussed at this conference and your past achievements, experiences, shortcomings and lessons, you find a methodology for turning the work of Party cells decisively into the work of understanding people's minds, feelings and emotions and uniting the members of Party cells and other working people with different personalities and qualifications as firmly as your own family members are. Participating in this conference are 10 000 persons including Party cell secretaries in various sectors, mainly the exemplary ones working at production sites, senior officials of provincial Party committees and other Party committees performing equivalent functions to them, chief secretaries of the Party committees of cities, counties and industrial complexes and relevant officials of the Party Central Committee. Fully convinced that this conference will mark a significant occasion in further consolidating the foundations of the Party, building our revolutionary ranks into more invincible ones and bringing about a remarkable progress in implementing the decisions of the Party congress and in socialist construction, I declare the Sixth Conference of Cell Secretaries of the Workers' Party of Korea open. Closing Speech Comrade cell secretaries, The Sixth Conference of Cell Secretaries of the Workers' Party of Korea, which has been held to bring about a radical turn in strengthening the cells, the cornerstones and bases in consolidating and uniting the entire Party, is to wind up its work after achieving its objectives amidst the soaring political enthusiasm of all the participants. The conference made an in-depth review and analysis of the work of Party cells in the aspects of their merits and demerits and advanced major tasks they should carry out at present and the practical measures for improving the roles of their secretaries. The conference reaffirmed the significance and importance of strengthening Party cells in making the ideological and volitional unity of the entire Party rock-solid and powerfully propelling socialist construction. Expressed at the conference were firm determinations to carry out our immediate struggle tasks by enhancing the fighting efficiency of Party cells. This conference will be etched in the annals of building our Juche-oriented Party as a meaningful conference that further enriched its original ideology of building grass-roots organizations and set forth clear-cut action programmes for all of its cell secretaries. Comrade cell secretaries, Turning all Party cells into healthy and viable ones which are closely knitted in bonds of human feelings–this is the main idea of this conference. Those that are not knitted in bonds of human feelings cannot become loyal cells. Turning all Party cells into collectives closely knitted in bonds of human feelings is a prerequisite for strengthening the entire Party and an urgent problem that should be solved without fail at present. To this end, the Party Central Committee has advanced at this conference ten major tasks that face Party cells and twelve major traits which their secretaries should possess. You, Party cell secretaries, must become the mainstay in making the cells families closely knitted in bonds of human feelings and, in doing this, will have to suffer from mental pains alone for others and work harder than anybody else. Just as mothers always concern themselves with the life and growth of their children and guide them along the right path, Party cell secretaries should patiently educate and lead Party members with warm affection and devotion. By doing so, they can train them into fighters boundlessly faithful to the Party and the revolution and into genuine revolutionary comrades-in-arms who share the same ideas and feelings Only then can they turn Party cells under their charge into collectives closely knitted in bonds of human feelings and into vanguard organizations which share sweets and bitters and creditably carry out their revolutionary tasks, overcoming hardships. They should efficiently lead the work of their cells in implementing the strategic tasks advanced by the Party congress. When they rouse up the spiritual strength of the masses of the people with powerful political work and make breakthroughs in the vanguard, miraculous innovations can be created in all work places. Since they are always among the masses, how they speak and behave act promptly on the latter's psychology and have a great impact on them. Party cell secretaries should become skilful political activists who can move the hearts of the people by dint of tremendous strength, that is, undivided hearts. They should always take the lead in tackling difficult and labour-consuming work and become forerunners who uninterruptedly create new things with an innovative way of thinking and style of work. Comrade cell secretaries, Through this conference, you must have realized once again how heavy is the responsibility you have assumed before the Party and the revolution. Our Party remains powerful and unflinching not because there exist its General Secretary or the Political Bureau and Secretariat of its Central Committee but because there are its cells, combat units in direct charge of carrying out its lines and policies and grass-roots organizations, and its cell secretaries who have assumed responsibility for it. While working together with the masses at the production sites at which the Party's intentions are being implemented, Party cell secretaries have stood in the vanguard of struggle when the Party advances, become bodyguards and a shock brigade in defending the Party at the cost of their lives when the Party undergoes trials and unyieldingly supported the Party with silent and unassuming efforts through their self-sacrificing endeavours and struggle at all times, wherever they are; but for them, the great changes our Party has achieved and the road of victory it has traversed is inconceivable. Though they are not distinguishable from ordinary people in terms of position, special favour or reward, our Party cell secretaries who are cornerstones and reliable standard bearers and vanguard fighters in the great work unfolded by our Party are career revolutionaries with no special positions, as well as unknown heroes of unknown heroes who work with devotion for the Party without asking for any reward. So, always feeling grateful to them, I have decided that I would request them, the hardcore of hardcore of our Party, to make greater efforts and struggle harder once more for our revolution and for our Party. Comrade cell secretaries, There are many obstacles and difficulties ahead of us, and so our struggle for carrying out the decisions of the Eighth Party Congress would not be all plain sailing. Our Party never expects that there will be any fortuitous opportunity for us in paving the road for our people and in realizing their great aim and ideals to build socialism and communism. There is nothing we could depend on or look to. We only believe in the hearts of the millions of WPK members, especially hundreds of thousands of its cell secretaries. I made up my mind to ask the WPK organizations at all levels, including its Central Committee, and the cell secretaries of the entire Party to wage another more difficult ""Arduous March"" in order to relieve our people of the difficulty, even a little, as they have followed their Party as their mother and overcome all sorts of difficulties for several decades to defend it and to provide them with the optimum material and cultural wellbeing. Our people are invariably following our Party calling it a motherly party in times of both happiness and difficulty. This is a valuable title bestowed only on the Workers' Party of Korea in the world and the greatest honour and glory that can neither be bought for billions of tons of gold nor be bartered for anything. Now our Party must, at all costs, prove itself worthy of the great trust of the people who unreservedly address it as ""mother."" To this end, it must become a genuine ""servant"" party for them. Comrade cell secretaries, Availing myself of this opportunity, I make a militant appeal once again to all the Party officials and cell secretaries to redouble their efforts to live up to this great name given by our people, motherly Party, which is a source of its infinite strength, symbol of its invincibility and unique title and appellation of the Workers' Party of Korea and to safeguard and add eternal brilliance to this glorious honour. When the hundreds of thousands of cell secretaries and officials across the Party unite its members firmly under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and give full play to their loyalty, patriotism and creative wisdom, our revolution will always emerge victorious in high spirits and the ideal of communism will surely come true. Firmly convinced that the participants and all other cell secretaries across the Party, mindful of the main idea of this conference and the tasks advanced by it, will devote themselves to strengthening and developing Party cells and thus make an active contribution to consolidating and uniting the entire Party, I declare the Sixth Conference of Cell Secretaries of the Workers' Party of
